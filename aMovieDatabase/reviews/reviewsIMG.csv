daisyrowley,"Avatar is an overwhelming, immersive spectacle. The state-of-the-art 3D technology draws us in, but it is the vivid weirdness of Cameron's luridly imagined tropical other world that keeps us fascinated. I like this film and I have written many review for <a href=""https://domywriting.com/"">essay writing service</a>. The special effects are so good here that you don't even notice them. It is eerie how Cameron has made it look and feel like he is just pointing a camera at the action."
John Chard,"It's cinema Jim, but not as we know it. 

So here it is then, what has been in gestation in James Cameron's mind for over 12 years finally hit the silver screen towards the back end of 2009. Made for gazillions amount of cash, Avatar went on to make a billion trillion in Worldwide receipts-and this before the rush rush release of DVD/BLU RAY sales are factored into the equation. The film, and all its technical wizardry, is quite simply a gargantuan piece of cinematic history. Released in 2d and 3d, and probably some other format that I'm forgetting, every advanced tool of the trade has been utilised by Cameron and his team to create what is now the ultimate popcorn blockbuster. Shame then, that away from the visual extravaganza the film is as shallow as this review will ultimately end up being.

No doubt about it, this is a joy for the eyes and ears, the minuscule details are wonderful and the colour positively pings from every frame. But in the eagerness to create such splendour they forgot to put any substance into the writing. This is plot simplicity. And even its messages, as Cameron smugly preaches his sermon from the pulpit, now seem old hat. Do we really need another boink over the head about eco invasion? Or a curt reminder of American infiltration into some land where motives are suspicious at best? No we don't really do we? Worse still is some of the dialogue, which quite frankly could have come from some playground encounter as the kiddies play kiss chase or bang bang your dead army. There's also a sense of familiarity with other better scripted film's, Dances *cough* With *cough* Wolves *cough* It's as if Cameron just knew that narrative structure wasn't as important as having the expensive gimmicks. He's like a modern day William Castle-only with considerably more readies at his disposal.

The cast are OK, Zoe Saldana puts a sexy feistiness to her blue alien Neytiri, Sam Worthington keeps the humanistic elements just about above water, while Sigourney Weaver is as ever the consummate professional. But ironically, in a film shimmering bright in 2d & 3d, the characters are all one dimensional. None more so than Stephen ""The Party Crasher"" Lang's Colonel. A man so gruff and gung-ho menacing he really ought to be in Sly Stallone's upcoming testo movie The Expendables. Nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, it won three, for Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, and Best Art Direction. Those were richly deserved. They also tell us all we need to now about Cameron's Behemoth. 5/10"
MSB,"Rewatching Avatar confirmed my love for Pandora. Exquisite world-building by James Cameron, memorable score by James Horner & jaw-dropping, innovative visuals that complement wonderful storytelling.

How can people not remember these characters?! Super excited about tomorrow's IMAX screening of Avatar: The Way of Water!"

In hindsight my excitement for Spectre seems a bit foolish. After Skyfall, director Sam Mendes openly stated that he wouldn’t direct another Bond movie. And even so, Skyfall wasn’t the best of the new Bond films by any measure – dragging on for much too long. But somehow I got sucked into the hype of Mendes’ vision for an homage to the classic Bond, with that somewhat iconic poster of Craig mimicking Roger Moore, and trailers the emphasized a kind of retro re-visitation of some old villains and themes. But Spectre is none of those things, instead it is a film where everyone involved feels like they are just going through the motions. Spectre tries very hard to be an homage to the vintage James Bond classics, but instead ends up feeling more like a mockery of the series.

For starters the script is outrageously weak and predictable. Bond goes from shootout, to chase, to sex scene, saying and doing the exact same things he has done for the last 23 movies. Instead of a complete story, the film is just a collection of set pieces and scenes loosely stitched together. And while some of them work well on their own, by the second or third fight scene, you won’t be able to stop yourself from yawning. When you aren’t yawning you’ll be laughing, and not in a good way. The dialogue is downright cheesy. Gone is all of Bond’s smooth charm and ability to sting his opponent’s with his tongue just as much as with his gun. Instead at one point, he throws a watch bomb and says: “Time flies!”

Bond is one a secret mission, assigned to him by M (Judi Dench) via a video message delivered after her death. The film doesn’t ever attempt to invest the audience in this mission, or in Bond’s motivation for seeking out Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz) – which apparently has something to do with his foster-father and his childhood, again – but it never seems important to the story or to James. Meanwhile, a new joint secretary, Max or C as he is known (Andrew Scott), is attempting to unite the world’s intelligence under one surveillance network – and through doing so making the Double-0 program obsolete. Lucky for him, Sam Mendes is already doing that for him.

However, Spectre is a beautiful film. There are about five or six huge set pieces, all of which are wonderfully filmed. And if you are just in the mood the veg out and watch Bond cruise through the streets of Rome in a prototype Aston Martin, than this is the movie for you. But things go on for entirely too long, which would be fine if something of interest were happening. But almost nothing does. Bond gets in a situation and gets out, all while throwing a few pithy, laughable, lines out.

Daniel Craig has never been more disconnected from the character James Bond, than he is in Spectre. I must say first, that I love Craig as an actor and as James Bond – he is my favorite of all the Bonds. But here, he is uncharacteristically not James Bond. A scene for instance where bond throws his gun into the river, is done in such a fancy foppish way that I cringed. It is tough to properly convey how Craig misses the mark in Spectre, but when you see it, you won’t be able to help feeling the same way.

Maybe Sam Mendes and screenwriter John Logan did succeed at creating a perfect homage to the Roger Moore era Bond films? Because in reality, none of those films standout as great movies. From start to finish, Spectre feels like someone filling out a madlibs of Bond scenes, and praying that when they read it back, it makes some sense."
Frank Ochieng,"Well, cinema’s most treasured and resilient British spy guy is back as the legendary James Bond makes his twenty-fourth outing on the big screen in the highly anticipated and slickly-made Spectre. Worldwide Agent 007 fans understandably maintain their embedded expectations and vision as to what calculating and cunning mission their suave and sophisticated gun-toting, martini-sipping espionage thrill-seeker will encounter in his latest globe-trotting episode. Whatever Bond enthusiasts have in mind for the future twenty-fifth entry of the “licensed to kill” Lothario they should simply settle for the present stimulating currents that trickle as mind-bending material in the polished and percolating Spectre.

As for the dynamic performer that have served his time with action-oriented cinematic sensibilities through three previous super-charged James Bond installments, the steely-jawed and diligent Daniel Craig is back on the saddle again for his fourth stint as the crafty 007. Naturally both ardent and casual Bond followers can rattle off the filmography of Craig’s on-screen tour of duty as the debonair and daring secret service operative and even rate the previous films as they compare and contrast each edition.  Some may give special attention to Craig’s first foray into stepping inside Bond’s explosive shoes for 2006’s Casino Royale that is considered a spectacular introduction for the dramatically trained actor. In 2008’s Quantum of Solace, it was a mixed bag at best as Bond followers for the most part gave this second 007 rendition an ambivalent sign of approval (not too many were thrilled with the awkward movie title either). Thankfully, 2012’s Skyfall bounced back for Craig’s take on the roguish Bond and made for some exceptional brownie points as the cagey spy returning to creative prominence. Now 2015’s Spectre hopes to make some hearty tie-ins to Craig’s past big screen adventures as the stoic jet-setting dynamo ridding the world of masterful riff raff.

In actuality, Spectre is serviceable in that it is an elaborate and excitable reminder of the preceding Bond films where bits of nostalgic elements from yesteryear are sprinkled throughout its presentation. Sure, some wily 007 fanatics may spot a few of the tossed in nods to the aforementioned Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace in particular as the proceedings unfold. For the most part, Spectre acts as a mere bridge to the launching of the upcoming 25th Bond actioner in waiting. To be fair the other Bond films have served as a welcome mat to the next chapter of the late Ian Fleming’s engaging and charismatic man of action so why should not Spectre be any different in this regard? Still, this spy caper has its signature swagger that Bond aficionados relish with familiarity: heart-pumping action sequences, exquisite locales, desirable and devious Bond women, majestic car chases, larger-than-life villains and their loyal henchmen, imaginative gadgets and inventive technology and yes…the indomitable James Bond at your service. Nevertheless. the minor knock on Spectre is that it could have risen to the occasion more than it did as it occasionally feels as if it is going through the mischievous motions. It never resorts to the levels of Bond-ish drudgery in Quantum of Solace so that certainly is a relief in that aspect.

Spectre does incorporate its share of opulence, mystery, suspense, shadowy tension and perilous plight. However, where the standard Bond film-making characteristics are somewhat consistent and captivating (i.e. the breathtaking opening sequence of the Day of the Dead celebration in Mexico City) there is also a questionable consideration for the weak-kneed Bond theme song in Sam Smith’s “Writing’s on the Wall” which seems so inadequately suited for a James Bond signature tune. Even the indifferent observers of the James Bond film franchise for the last five decades can attest to the two most important stamps of a Bond film–its opening scene and surging theme song.  Thankfully, Spectre’s grand opening sequence obeys traditional Bond practices but Smith’s doggedly tired-sounding “Writing’s on the Wall” feels as it belongs attached to an old televised After School special from the mid-70s. Wouldn’t you give your kingdom for Paul McCartney and Wings’ “Live and Let Die” or Carly Simon’s “Nobody Does It Better” or perhaps even Sheena Easton’s “For Your Eyes Only”?

One thing that can be said about Craig’s Bond in Spectre and that is his image transformation has been elevated to that of a fashion plate whose GQ stylized look has taken quite a step up. Not since Roger Moore’s Bond has there been a clear case of dazzling attire on display for Agent 007 to strut his stuff in spiffy clothing accessories throughout his ventured travels. Craig, billed as a “blue-collar” Bond whose demeanor is more blunt and workman-like, takes comfort in basking in the finesse shadows of a classic Agent 007 almost foreign to his distinctive spin on the iconic spy. In fact, the overall vibe for Spectre seems to lie in the middle of old school and new school James Bond mythology where the shading suits both camps of the ever-lasting film franchise.

Director Sam Mendes, who handled the direction for the previous Skyfall, finds the right tone and temple for Spectre that certainly shows off its lavish and ambitious production values as the set designs, scenic locations, fabulous pre-credits action sequence are all indescribable in majestic scope. No one can accuse Spectre as to not holding its own in visual functionality. Wisely, Mendes does not forget his Skyfall background players as they reunite with Craig’s Bond and partake in the sensationalized cat-and-mouse caper. It is refreshing to see Ralph Fiennes back as “M” not to mention Ben Wishaw’s “Q” front and center. And a Craig-fronted Bond film would not be the same without Naomie Harris as Miss Moneypenny.

Agent 007 fans will find a common ""Bond"" with Daniel Craig and his fourth outing as the licensed to kill Lothario in the stunning and kinettic SPECTRE
Agent 007 fans will find a common “Bond” with Daniel Craig and his fourth outing as the licensed to kill Lothario in the stunning and kinetic SPECTRE
It is a given that the diabolical criminal network known as SPECTRE has always had its affiliation with the Bond universe especially in the classic Sean Connery Bond-age years. Instinctively, SPECTRE’s evil heart and soul was pumped continuously by that organization’s dastardly mastermind Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Oscar winner Christoph Waltz does the sordid honors of taking the reins as Bond’s nemesis Franz Oberhauser in Spectre with devilish delight and is more colorfully corrupt thanks to his handy go-to muscular minion Mr. Hinx (ex-professional WWE wrestler and “Guardians of the Galaxy” star Dave Bautista) echoing the memories of beloved brute Jaws (played by the late Richard Kiel) from The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker). 

We can never forget that along with Agent 007 folklore comes the responsibility of being labeled a treasured Bond babe. And although the latest sultry women represented in Spectre will never make us forget the iconic likes of Dr. No’s Ursula Andress (Honey Ryder) or Casino Royale’s Eva Green (Vesper Lynd) for that matter they still hold their own and give a measure of titillation to both Bond and the vast amount of male admirers wishing they carried a gun and wore expensive tuxedos while being at the receiving end of a provocative smooch by these vibrant vixens. Lea Seydoux’s Madelene Swann and Italian siren Monica Bellucci’s Lucia are on board as the Bond bombshells for hire.

As a whole, Spectre has its up and down moments and never is quite sure about standing alone as an independent Bond story or being dismissed as a pit stop for 007-related flashbacks and reference bits ode to yesteryear’s glory of the super spy’s engaging and raging exploits. The verdict is that Spectre ultimately satisfies one’s craving for the invincible James Bond whether you can to relive his vintage reputation or look forward to a millennium-enhanced production that will grow with the ageless wonderment pertaining to Fleming’s literary ladies man-turned movie-making mainstay of action-packed cinema for half a century. As one-time Bond songbird Carly Simon would attest in her soothing lyrics, “nobody does it better…”  Yet in the dimensional escapist world of James Bond this particular go-around could have been a tad bit better.

Andres Gomez,"A ""correct"" Bond movie. All the expected stereotypes are included, Waltz is an OK bad guy and the intro scene is something really impressive.

Nothing else really new ..."
Reno,"> Not your usual Bond movie, but still a good entertainer.

What I liked from a couple of last Bond movies was they were off the regular 007 style, like not overly rely on spy's special gadgets. This change has been since the day one of Daniel Craig as a famous British spy, James Bond. Anyway, he's the most fittest (muscular) Bond I've ever seen and he's celebrating 10 year anniversary with this film release. But the question is whether he to do another film or done with the franchise. The doubt after the confusing end of this film.

The end was quite clear on the story perspective, so I kind of felt it was a farewell for Craig. But, later I came to know that the official source says Bond25 will be his fifth and so on till he opts out himself. 'Spectre' was a very simple Bond movie I have ever seen, but I can say the production quality was so good that you can't resist the enjoyment. The actors, they were also good, but not as I anticipated. Maybe many scenes were very ordinary for a Bond movie, that's comparable with the nowadays action movies, otherwise it was not as bad as critics expressing their disappointment.

You can't believe what I was disappointed, you know when they say what the C stands for - is that the best word they come up with against the M for Moron? Anyway, James Bond movies have always had ups and downs, the last film 'Skyfall' was a mega hit and now this has not stood up to that standard. But very entertaining with all the actions and unexpected turns in the narration. As a spy movie, it was okay, but as a Bond movie is what might upset you, so its upto you how you look at it. But to be honest, I enjoyed it.

MSB,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/spectre-spoiler-free-review

""Spectre fails to reach the tremendous potential of its intriguing narrative and fascinating antagonist, but Sam Mendes still pulls off a decent James Bond flick.

The screenplay raises significant issues with an incredibly dull subplot that deeply affects the pacing of a bloated runtime. In addition to this, Christoph Waltz's lack of impactful screentime is disappointing, to say the least, despite a brilliant performance from the actor.

Fortunately, the jaw-dropping action set pieces elevate the overall film, which also benefits from gorgeous cinematography (Hoyte van Hoytema) and exceptional acting across the board. Daniel Craig and Léa Seydoux's characters relationship is emotionally compelling, making Bond's mission feel more like an interesting personal journey.

One of the best movies of the franchise is buried somewhere under the messy screenplay, but what can be found at the surface has much to appreciate.""

Rating: B"
CinemaSerf,"Now that Dame Judi has shaken her off her cinematic mortal coil, the new ""M"" (Ralph Fiennes) is facing increasing pressure from whizzkid ""C"" (Andrew Scott) to shut down the 007 programme and rely on an international, computer generated, system of intelligence gathering. Needless to say, ""007"" (Daniel Craig) has his doubts about this and after a manhunt to Rome (via Mexico) that must have cost billions, he alights on an exclusive gathering of the criminal great and good working for the eponymous organisation. Along the way, he manages to enlist ""Q"" (Ben Whishaw) and ""Moneypenny"" (Naomie Harris) in his quest to find the daughter of his old nemesis ""Mr White"". She - ""Madeleine"" (Léo Seydoux) may well know how to help him thwart the ambitions of this secretive and deadly organisation before it is all too late. There are plenty of (extended) action scenes here and the gadgets work well enough, but the story is thin and the characterisations lacking. The dynamic lacks jeopardy - we know who is likely to be behind the cunning plots right from the start and neither Fiennes nor Scott bring much to the party. Indeed the latter is really rather poor. What menace there is, is delivered via some underwhelming contributions from Dave Bautista's ""Hinx"" and from the appearances of Christoph Waltz, but they are all too infrequent to bolster the storyline before an ending that was, frankly, ridiculous - even by ""Quantum of Solace"" (2008) standards. The producers seem to be constantly trying to reinvent ""Bond"" without realising that the more they compromise the standards of the story and weaken the traditional characters, the less impact the franchise has when surrounded by many others of this genre that benefit from stronger writing and a more charismatic star. This is shorter than many of Daniel Craig's other outings as Ian Fleming's master spy, for which I was grateful because this is all rather mediocre from start to finish."
Travis Bell,"I felt like this was a tremendous end to Nolan's Batman trilogy. The Dark Knight Rises may very well have been the weakest of all 3 films but when you're talking about a scale of this magnitude, it still makes this one of the best movies I've seen in the past few years.

I expected a little more _Batman_ than we got (especially with a runtime of 2:45) but while the story around the fall of Bruce Wayne and Gotham City was good I didn't find it amazing. This might be in fact, one of my only criticisms—it was a long movie but still, maybe too short for the story I felt was really being told. I feel confident in saying this big of a story could have been split into two movies.

The acting, editing, pacing, soundtrack and overall theme were the same 'as-close-to-perfect' as ever with any of Christopher Nolan's other films. Man does this guy know how to make a movie!

You don't have to be a Batman fan to enjoy these movies and I hope any of you who feel this way re-consider. These 3 movies are without a doubt in my mind, the finest display of comic mythology ever told on the big screen. They are damn near perfect."
Chris,"I personally thought this film is on par if not better than the Dark Knight.

Whilst some think the film is too long for the story I didn't find this. The length of the film is longer than some (but doesn't feel it), I liked that the film took it's time rather than shoving more elements in it - I think this contributed to the dramatic ending (much like a classical piece of music will be relaxed and calm before the final crescendo).

At the end of the day whether you like this film will boil down to if you like films Christopher Nolan has directed and/or you like the Christopher Nolan Batman series so far.

Stupendously good film in my opinion."
GeekMasher,"The Dark Knight Rises is one of the best movies to come out in 2012. The story compels you to watch it time and time again. It also has I of, I my opinion, the best bad guys in any movie, Bane! Batman was well played as all ways and the cast where well selected. I think this movie is the best batman to see the light of day or the darkest nights (pun intended)."
Im_Infinity,"No doubt that the movie is one of the best movies of this era.
The film doesn't lack in whatever it try to do.It has Simple narration with extraordinary Direction,Acting,Music,Cinematography and a lot of qualities.
Christian Bale is supremely entertaining for sure.
The person behind the scenes is actually the real core creater of the film yes! The Director Christopher Nolan ❤ .
The film ofcorse completes with philosophical quality loaded with Lots of Sacrifices.
This one is the one you surely can't afford to miss.
Go watch The Dark Knight.Go now."
talisencrw,"While it's clearly not as superlative as its famous predecessor, it's simply because of both Heath Ledger's outstanding and Oscar-winning performance, and the character of the Joker's etching in our collective unconscious as the greatest comic-book villain ever created (with Lex Luthor a very distant second place). This is still a masterwork, and is an excellent coda to the finest filmic trilogy ever made. As great as Christopher Nolan is as a director, and as fine a film as 'Interstellar' is, I really don't know if he'll ever be able to top his work here, on these three films. But I, for one, am certainly looking forward to finding out..."
DoryDarko,"So here we have it. The end of a trilogy, the end of an era of the universe of Batman through the eyes of Christopher Nolan. And baby, it goes out with a bang...

Going into the theatre tonight I actually wasn't sure what I was up for. I loved Batman Begins, but I didn't actually care that much for The Dark Knight. So the big question was, will TDKR actually be more like the first or the second film? The answer is: neither.

This third instalment of the Nolan-franchise carries its weight all on its own merits. Despite the lack of any kind of intro or opening credits, there actually is plenty of build-up (partly thanks to the insane opening scene). The foundation for a proper, action-packed story is laid down perfectly, explaining things just enough whilst keeping the viewer intrigued to find out more. But if you thought that Nolan couldn't surpass his previous work, you will be pleasantly deceived.

Christian Bale as Batman is terrific. Never before was a superhero so human, so vulnerable. As his mask of intangibility and anonymity slowly starts to crumble, this is a man who questions his reasons to keep being who he is, and he must figure it out before it is too late. Because somebody’s preparing to take him and Gotham down, and he might just be too strong for the Batman...

This somebody is a character called Bane. As a character, an actor and a performance it must be incredibly hard to follow Heath Ledger's The Joker, which was easily one of the greatest villains to ever appear on the silver screen. But tonight, Tom Hardy took a swing for the fence... and made it. His performance is thrilling and actually frightening, in the sense that you don't just *know* you're supposed to be afraid of this character, you actually FEEL it. He instils a feeling of horror and discomfort that is not rivalled by many other film villains. What I actually liked about his character the most is the fact that unlike Scarecrow, who grew into being a villain, and the Joker, who was just a raving maniac, Bane was actually (literally) born from evil. Born in hell, as it is said in the film. This is not a man, this is a creature. A living, breathing manifestation of evil that cannot be reasoned or negotiated with. Hardy's performance is masterful. Since his creepy mask is never removed, he, like only a few actors before him, must act without the use of any facial expressions, making his voice is main tool. His manner of speech (and the sound of it through his mask) is enough to send chills down your spine. This is more than just a another villain from a superhero flick, this is a character that just got torpedoed into the top 10 of the greatest antagonists in the history of film. Now I realise that's a bold statement to make, but you just go and watch TDKR and prove me wrong.

I would say a slight downside to this film is the overflow of characters, both new and old. Aside from the already familiar characters, three new major ones are introduced. And there are also many characters running along in the margin which may seem not important enough to pay attention to, but actually they are so you need to stay focused.

I understand the character of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Blake, was written in specifically for him because Nolan wanted him in it. And although as a character he works just fine, it does feel like it was at the expense of Gary Oldman. As a cop, Levitt does everything that Oldman's character could've done, but he spends most of his screen time in the hospital, almost like they wanted to get him out of the way, and that's really too bad.

Now, I was extremely excited to see what Nolan had done with Catwoman, because she is one of my favourite film characters. When I heard that she would be played by Anne Hathaway, I had my doubts. I thought she was just way too sweet to pull this off. But I must say, Ms Hathaway did a pretty good job. She is actually much more sly and devious than I thought she could be. The Nolan brothers, on the other hand, disappointed me here. Catwoman isn't really Catwoman, she's just a sexy girl in a spandex suit who can kick your ass. Her movements aren't even typically cat-like... So that was a bit of a letdown.

I would also like to make a note on Michael Caine. I think his performance here was so much deeper and more character-driven than the other two films. In fact, there is one scene in particular, where he confesses something to Bruce, that almost moved me to tears. And this is actually TDKR’s greatest strength; unlike the other two films, this one deals much more with actual human emotions, it gives us an insight into what actually drives these characters, both heroes and villains alike. 

As much as I would love to, the word-limit restricts me from elaborating more on the characters, so I'll just move on to the technical stuff. And in that department, actually pretty much everything was perfect. The pacing was very well balanced, and during those 2 ½ hours I didn't get bored once. Great action scenes alternate with more quiet moments, and the special effects are absolutely awesome. Hans Zimmer once again delivered a terrific score and there was some high quality dialogue. Also in store: a couple of great plot twists and two very cool cameos... There are a few plot holes, but everything else easily makes up for it. 

I highly recommend The Dark Knight Rises. It is a worthy conclusion to the trilogy, and it far exceeded my expectations.
_(July 2012)_"
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"Batman was one of my childhood heroes from the Comic magazines even though the Swedish plonkers, in their infinite stupidity, had renamed him to something as ridiculous “Läderlappen” which basically translates into “patch of leather”.

Thus, when Christopher Nolan brought us Batman Begins and steered away from the ridiculous comic shows that the previous batman movies (except the first one) had turned into I was thrilled. Unfortunately I was equally disappointed with this one.

I think the title of the movie is quite misleading since Batman isn’t exactly rising at all but rather sinking. If this would have been a movie about some other “guy” it would probably have been excellent but it isn’t. It’s about Batman and as such I had expected him to be the hero going around beating up the bad guys.

Instead the movie starts downright boring with Batman having dug himself down into a swamp of melancholy and closed himself off from the world. When he finally starts to appear again he gets pretty much beaten at every turn not to mention conned out of the Wayne fortune. What the f… is that? It isn’t until the end that he starts to be the real Batman and even then it’s not very exciting.

Actually Batman, as in Batman and not Wayne, is not really in the movie for a good chunk of the time and the real hero in this movie is really the young cop and he sure isn’t a particularly good substitute for the superhero Batman that I was expecting to watch.

I was struggling with what to give this movie but in the end, since I probably would have thought it to be a good movie if it had not been labelled as a Batman movie, I gave it 5 out 10 stars. At least the special effects where quite okay."
Reviewsforlife,"""And when it is done, and Gotham is in ashes, then you have my permission to die."" - Bane, the Dark Knight Rises.

An epic, amazing end to the Dark Knight trilogy, with great acting, numerous complex subplots, a creepy villain, amazing action scenes and a heart-thumping score. I really love this film and consider it one of Nolan's better works, and I wish more people on the Internet would start giving it more respect.

Oh, also, I really don't care about the small plot holes like the magic mechanical leg and Bruce appearing in Gotham when he was at the desert shortly before - do you really want to see ten minutes of Bruce using plastic surgery to fix his bone, or him in a airport going to Gotham?"
AstroNoud,"Even though the plot feels messier than the previous two installments, one cannot resist a smile after the unexpected twist and final scenes, which make ‘The Dark Knight Rises’ a worthy final chapter of Nolan's epical trilogy.

9/10"
CinemaSerf,"Tom Hardy is superb in this denouement to Christopher Nolan's ""Batman"" trilogy. His depiction of the clever and malevolent ""Bane"" is intricate and terrifying in equal measure. Christian Bale also has the role very much under control now as he joins forces with his old pal ""Gordon"" (Gary Oldman) and jewel thief turned ""Catwoman"" (Anne Hathaway) to rise to his biggest challenge yet... What's great about this film is that is ties up all of the loose ends from the first two; it dots some i's and crosses the t's as the story neatly, and frequently quite subtly, introduces new threads to an old suit of clothes. This is an hugely characterful outing for all concerned - especially Sir Michael Caine as the wonderfully underplayed ""Alfred"" and Morgan Freeman as the arch-inventor ""Fox"". The plot takes it's time to develop, there is plenty of to-ing and fro-ing as they battle for the upper hand; new allies must learn to trust and to rely on each other. I found myself drawn to the ""Bane"" cause more than I ought to admit - a sign of a great baddie; you empathise with the evil (I think of ""Darth Vader"") especially once the story unveils traits in his character and elements of his history that, to a certain extent, justify his behaviour. The dialogue is sparing and potent and photography is really effective: the light and shade are used creatively with the Hans Zimmer score an huge improvement on his last outing. This is certainly one for a big screen - there is loads to see each time you watch, and though ""Batman"" was never my favourite super-hero, this has to be up there as one of the darkest and best super-hero films."
Andres Gomez,Totally forgettable and full of stereotypes
YetAnotherMovieWatcher,"Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote his series of John Carter novels before space flight was more than a fancy.  This movie is more adventure and romance and very little (if any) actual science.

This movie is the best production of A Princess of Mars, the first story in the series, that I've seen.

If you're a fan of the John Carter novels then you will probably get some enjoyment from John Carter.  While there are some differences you'll meet some familiar characters and recognize quite a few relevant plot points.

Not a great film, but not a bad one, either."
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"We sat down and watched this movie on Blu-ray yesterday evening to nicely end our little excursion day. This is a good film but it could have been (much) better.

The film itself and its special effects are quite good. I would say that the special effects are very good. The airships are very cool looking. The design nicely captures the retro atmosphere of the book without looking silly. I think they made the green men too slim though. I have always pictured them as way more bulky and monstrous. I like Woola’s appearance although him moving around at “supersonic” speeds is a bit over the top.

However, why is it that every film-company/producer/director/whatever now thinks that he can take an old classic, slam on the name in the title, and then do what the hell he likes with the material? This film has borrowed the basic idea and the names from Edgar Rice Burroughs John Carter book but almost nothing else. At most 10% of the story of the books is in the movie. The rest is pure invention and it does not improve the story. As a matter of fact it turns what was a good story into a standard unintelligent Hollywood faire. Been there, seen that, done that.

The examples are plentiful, the white apes the size of dinosaurs, the city of Zodanga moves around (what the f…), most of the plot as I said before is invented, the Therns have a completely different role etc. etc.

I especially dislike how they have made John Carter, the honorable gentleman from Virginia, into a fairly plain American guy who at first refuses to do the “right” thing. And what about these bloody wife and child flashbacks? That’s just disturbing.

None of this improves the movie. It got 6 stars, it could have gotten 9 or 10 if it had followed the books properly. It is Disney’s own fault that this movie was a disappointment at the box office, they screwed with classical material…again."
r96sk,"Unfulfilled potential, still narrowly liked it.

<em>'John Carter'</em> can feel underdeveloped and underwhelming, you could even argue it aimed to replicate <em>'Avatar'</em>, but there's enough there that allowed me to find a fair amount of enjoyment.

Taylor Kitsch is alright, I rate him, but a more convincing lead performance was necessary in my opinion. The rest of the cast, despite some well known names, fail to deliver anything noteworthy. Willem Dafoe works as Tars Tarkas, though only due to his distinctive voice; none of his dialogue etc. stand outs. The likes Samantha Morton, Mark Strong and Bryan Cranston give forgettable performances; arguably not their fault.

The premise has all the possibilities to be great, sadly the film fails to make their mark with it. The ending is extremely rushed, even for a 132 minute production. Visually it's good, but that's one of very few plus points - I haven't got many truth be told, but anything less than a 7* feels harsh."
tmdb44006625,"After the success of the first two Spider-Man films, Spider-Man 3 represents Sam Raimi's inability to overcome the biggest hurdle of a third movie, a hurdle that Alien 3, The Godfather Part 3, RoboCop 3, and the list goes on could not: studio interference.

Although I wish that would be the only thing wrong with Spider-Man 3. But almost every storytelling decision - from the creation of Sandman to Peter instantly falling in love with his new costume to that thing that was never actually called Venom - is just plain stupid. Right from the get go you hate Peter Parker.

Studio interference did not mandate the jazz bar dance scene. It did not have the Green Goblin 2 storyline make absolutely no sense whatsoever. It did not create that stupid love triangle between Gwen and Mary Jane, betraying everything Peter Parker is supposed to be about.

These were fundamental issues in the script and direction the film took. These were issues that doomed the film for failure. That's why this movie sucks, not just because they butchered Venom."
Justin Lopez,"This movie is about Spidey's revenge and  transformation to bad Spidey. It has a dark feel to it that I found one of the most appealing factors to this movie. Because we've all gotten used to Peter Parker being ""your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man,” having him turn to the dark side for some time and watch him get out of it was a whole new experience."
LoganWright,"Tobey Maguire makes such a great Spider-Man, hands down. We've seen him at his best, but in this movie,  we saw him at his worst, and although I must say I wasn't that big of a fan of how cheesy he looked with that emo cut, it was still enjoyable for me watching him beat the ""venom"" out of him."
BradleyStewart,So much emotion in this movie! What a way to end a trilogy!
Jane Hall,The third and final film to one of the few trilogies we have that are actually good. Tobey surely gave a whole new meaning to Spider-Man and set the bar high for the other Spider-Man movies that came out.
JessieCollins,"I know this is supposed to have a darker tone than the normal Spider-Man movies we see, but I found it more comedic to see Peter take on an entirely new character. Loved it though!"
John Smith,"My wife isn't that big of a superhero fanatic but after watching this whole trilogy with me, I can say that she's still not a superhero fan! Still, I know she was able to enjoy the movie and how the creators told the story."
1RobertJohnson1,It still puzzles me to this day why this felt like two movies crammed into one.
MichaelWilliams,"Now that I think about it, this film just had too much going on. Compared to the first two which were both hyper-focused on just one storyline, Spider Man 3 lacked that distinct characteristic which I know most of us will agree on."
WilliamJones,"Out of all the Tobey Maguire Spider Man films, this one had the best effects. But with that, the overall quality of the movie in terms of the plot greatly decreased. I wish they would've stuck with the same strategies they had for the first two films."
DavidBrown1,"I was satisfied, but that already was a disappointment. Spider Man 2 was a great sequel and I had high hopes that they would outdo themselves again this time, but sad to say third time's not gonna be the charm for Spider Man."
JosephWilson,"Although I'd say that Sandman's acting was pretty on point, I still feel like he could've been cut out from the movie and it still would've made sense."
richardmiller,"Spider Man 3 is still pretty good but when you compare it with its other two predecessors, you can see that there is a huge step down in the overall quality of the film."
ThomasMoore,Man I wish they didn't have to kill off Harry so quickly after he had just reconciled with Peter. That scene broke me so much.
JeffreyYoung,They had too many concepts that they tried to cram in one movie that it ended up being an awkward mess.
JacobKing1,"Tobey Maguire isn't good at being bad. Don't get me wrong, he played a great Spider-Man in the first two films but he just isn't cut for being evil."
NicholasLopez,I really tried my best to not hate it but it's hard not to compare it to the first two successful Spider-Man movies.
StephenScott,It felt like a totally different Spider-Man. It's such a shame because they had such a good storyline that connected the previous films.
LarryAdams,Great action sequences and character development is lost when you try too hard to cram too many things into one 2-hour movie.
JustinCampbell,"Yes, there was too much to process, but I still think it's a great ending to an epic trilogy."
Andres Gomez,"Tangled main characters really remember Aladdin's. The chameleon character could have been more juicy and it also repeats with stubborn determination Disney's intent of making any other animal to behave like dogs.

All in all, it is a stereotypical Disney movie that nails the template but it does it so well that it is also really entertaining. In addition, they get to add some of the fresh characteristics brought by Shrek to the scene."
ohlalipop,"Been wanting to watch this movie for quite some time. But then I wasn't sure if I really wanted to watch this or not because it might be just like Frog Prince (which I haven't seen completely yet). Even if I was tired (slept late the night before and woke up early when we got a phone call that Matt and Toby will come over to play Wii) and I didn't have money anymore, I wanted to watch this movie just to keep Matt entertained.

I wasn't disappointed. I really like this movie. It was like a classic Disney movie: a Princess, her prince charming, animal sidekick, and the best of all, MUSIC! I liked how the Princess was not the typical Disney princess. Rapunzel was strong and active. She wasn't very timid and proper like the usual Disney princess that I grew up watching. Flynn Rider was really cute which was a big plus. He was really charming. The animal sidekicks, Mascal and Maximus, were funny. All in all, I really like this movie and I strongly recommend it to all."
r96sk,"An enjoyable tale about Rapunzel.

<em>'Tangled'</em> kicks off Disney's animated releases for the 2010s in very strong fashion. It's nicely created, with fun characters and a hearty storyline. It actually sets a lot of the foundations that 2013's <em>'Frozen'</em> uses, there's a fair amount of similarities between the two.

Mandy Moore does a terrific job in the lead role, she's brings an energetic edge to the character alongside good humour. Zachary Levi (Flynn) and Donna Murphy (Mother Gothel) are more than decent in their respective parts. You also have the amusing (non-speaking) Maximus.

It's still very much the usual fairytale/princess thing, but it manages to add a lively turn to proceedings which keeps it entertaining."
John,"Might be my favorite Disney movie. My girls love it, and the hidden relationship metaphors are fun for adults to figure out."
Hotsake,There is a lot going on in this movie but it all just seemed kind of pointless and dull to me. Every now and then there would be a good scene or piece of dialogue but for the most part I felt myself getting bored and reaching for my phone to play Cribbage. I guess what I didn't like most is that it all felt like a big filler episode instead of an action packed character driven story arc.
Andres Gomez,"Action, good Fx and a ""not-completely-absurd"" story. The actors perform well and you can identify them very well with their characters ... but it is all old and without imagination.

I suppose nobody was expecting anything else, though ..."
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"This is another one of those movies that you watch primarily for the special effects with you favourite super heroes slugging it out. It is a classical Hollywood product where the story is mostly there just as a vehicle for allowing the special effects team to do their business. As such it is a success.

The movie starts of with a display of action and the afore mentioned special effects with an attack by the Avengers on a bad guy stronghold. Not surprisingly the events sows the seeds for things to come.

The movie starts off with quite an interesting story idea with the activation of Ultron. However, once he materializes as a physical entity, it became a bit of seen that, been there and done that. Ultron just turns into yet another “standard” comic book villain a’ la Megatron running around trying to look intimidating while implementing his diabolical scheme. Okay, there was a bit of originality here and there but with the good start I kind of expected a wee bit more.

Having said that, the movie does indeed fulfil its purpose of showing off a bunch of super heroes slugging it out in a flurry of special effects and, although the story idea was perhaps not used as intelligently as I had hoped, it is not bad (for this kind of movie of course) and hangs together pretty okay. Sure, it is somewhat contrived and the means by which Ultron tries to exterminate humanity is overly complicated but it is still a decent story.

Overall the movie was entertaining and provided the necessary special effects and super hero fix for those who are inclined to enjoy those kind of movies. I certainly am and, not surprisingly, the kids liked it as well."
Gimly,"**A long form review originally posted in 2015:**

I’ve just returned from two back-to-back viewings of _Avengers: Age of Ultron_, and I do not regret one bit going in for that second helping.

I lost my steam on the _Age of Ultron_ wagon at a very inopportune moment. About three days before it came out. I was so heavily anticipating it for such a long time, that I was actually much more excited to see this movie when it was still two months away than I was waiting in line to get into the cinema it was playing at. The combination of the market-saturation and the fact that the _Ultron _hype-train has been running for literally years, with a first trailer dropping seven months before the damn thing came out, meant I got weary of the thing just a fraction too soon. But I’m a sucker for the MCU, and there was no way I was missing the sequel to my favourite superhero movie of all time.

I won’t harp on too much, because I don’t want to spoil anything (especially given that the movie isn’t even out in most parts of the world), I will put out a spoilertalk on this blog at some point down the line, but for now just let me leave you with a couple of quick thoughts.

_Age of Ultron_ is not the best film of all time. It’s not the best superhero film of all time, it’s not even the best MCU film. Honestly, I personally feel it’s not even the best MCU Phase 2 film. But it is still good. And that’s what’s important here. But what do I mean by that? 

Well, for starters, in and of itself, I loved it, a breach past an 80% approval rating from me is no small thing. The things we enjoyed from the first _Avengers_are here. The mesmerising action spectacles of course, but I more mean the character moments we got between the Avengers themselves, that was my favourite part of the first film and we get it here again in spades. 

Every new thing Joss has added to the plate works splendidly as well, real Hawkeye story, new heroes, a new villain, an updated world, all of these things are big ticks in lots of boxes.

So if everything from _The Avengers_ works and everything they’ve added works great too, why is _Age of Ultron_ not a perfect film? For spoiler-free purposes I will not go into detail, but that’s okay because the answer is quite simple: Everything in _Age of Ultron_ is great. It’s what’s not in _Age of Ultron_ that’s the problem.

Joss Whedon said that the film had to be cut by nearly an hour. That way you get more showings in, and that means more money. Now I’m not saying we need every minute of that hour back, but what we ended up being left with, was just enough for _Age of Ultron_ to be the _Thor: The Dark World_ of the _Avengers _franchise (it was a far superior film to _Dark World_, but hear me out). _Age of Ultron_ is little more than a holding pattern. The set-ups for future films take up too much time for the story to bear the weight of some actual story, but everything that occurs in the film itself somehow also has virtually no consequence on world it is a part of. I can’t say it more plainly than that: It’s a holding pattern. It introduces some stuff, but it doesn’t stand alone the first film did. It’s not such a big deal when the solo-movies do that (like the aforementioned _Dark World_) because we have _The Avengers_ films for those to pay off in. But when an _Avengers_ entry is just more of the same, I can’t fully get behind it.

That all said, _Age of Ultron_ is of course a lot of fun. A huge amount of fun, I can’t state that enough. And there’s literally nothing more important something in the entertainment industry can be. These are just the things holding it back from taking it up to the next level (or if I’m being completely honest, even taking it to the level the first film was at).

tmdb44006625,"The fact that Joss Whedon was able to salvage some sort of coherent film out of all he was forced to cram into a single movie is quite commendable. But the sad fact is that Avengers: Age of Ultron is really just a run of the mill ""bad guy wants to destroy the world for reasons"" actioner that we've seen done better many times before.

Don't get me wrong. The movie's fun. The dialogue is frequently clever and humourous. And I really appreciated the quiet bits of storytelling that Whedon was able to sneak in. It's just that at the end of the day, the villain is weak sauce, there's way too much set up for other movies, and if I'm criticizing Man of Steel for having excessive destruction, I can't give Avengers a pass since they needlessly blow up not one, not two, but three cities. Pretty sure many insurance agencies went bankrupt paying out all the victims."
Justin Lopez,"Movie was great but felt like there was just too much action and fighting. The creativity of the choreography gets lost in the whirlwind of action and this I noticed most in Captain America's scenes. He does like a hundred different awesome things with his shield, but you don't have time to really take it in because you're already looking at Iron Man blasting 20 Ultron-bots to bits."
LoganWright,"This is the movie where Captain America became my favorite Avenger. Sure he doesn't have monstrous abilities like Iron Man and Hulk, but to be holding his own on the same ground as them is just a testament to how great of a hero he truly is."
BradleyStewart,"It has become a well-known fact that coming out with a sequel that's better than, if not on par with, the first one is an insane task. But kudos to Marvel for staying true to their colors with this sequel."
Jane Hall,I expected more from Quicksilver.  He would've been a great addition to the Avengers.
JessieCollins,"The thing that puzzles me is that in this film, Vision is presented to be a powerful hero, having the mind stone and all. But on the next films, he's become more of like a side character that just wasn't relevant anymore except for that little piece of stone on his forehead. Shame."
John Smith,I'm glad to see that they found another role for Hawkeye other than being that one guy who seemed to be trying hard to keep up with the other more powerful heroes on the team. Now he's more of like the thing that keeps the team together and it suits his character well.
Justin Lopez,"Movie was great but felt like there was just too much action and fighting.

1RobertJohnson1,"Avengers: Age of Ultron
I liked plenty of the stuff in it but it was pretty much the same as the first movie. Still a good watch though if you're not looking for anything serious."
MichaelWilliams,The humor in this movie was not as witty as the first one. It felt too childish and cheesy.
WilliamJones,"Still good, clean Avengers fun though a bit messier. The first one was still better."
DavidBrown1,"With the vast array of heroes and their own personal character stories, you can expect how much of a challenge it is to bring together all these superheroes and have them work on a single mission on a single timeline. It's not easy, experts."
JosephWilson,I confirmed in this movie that what's really making these films successful is the chemistry that the actors have. You can really see that everyone's doing their best.
richardmiller,"Strong film from beginning to end. Has just enough humor, angst, and drama to make it a film worthy to be called a sequel."
ThomasMoore,"If you're a fan of action, suspense, and awe worthy moments, then this movie is the right fit for you! Overall outstanding performance by everyone both on and off screen."
JeffreyYoung,"Despite the challenge of having to top their first Avengers film, Marvel did beautifully and the result was amazing. I hope to see more films like this in the future."
John Chard,"Hormones over excitement as part six is merely an appetiser to the double billed closure to come.

Death Eaters are running amok as Dumbledore has an important task for Harry and Voldermort has one for Draco; all set to the backdrop of raging adolescent hormones. While Harry also acquires a rather helpful book written by the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.

Potter 6 is not as dark as the pre-release chattings suggested it would be. Yes there's the usual dark moments, including a shattering turn of events that sets it up nicely for the finale, but this instalment is mostly fun, gentle and even sexy. Harry, Ron & Hermione are more under threat from their own adolescent urges than they are from the swirl of a Death Eater or the appearance of one young & creepy Tom Riddle. This of course makes for good viewing to most of us who have grown with the characters, with the principal young actors having nicely grown into said characters. But can it sustain a two and half hour running time? No it can't is the ass numbingly honest answer. There's some quality set-pieces including Quiddich (for a change) and a swamp attack by the Death Eaters, but by and large it's talky and breezy in equal measure.

A filler Potter movie then, one that is far breezier than expected. Good but not great, but as a set up for the epic conclusion it hits all the right buttons. 6/10"
John Chard,"The seventh installment, the appetiser.

As the ultimate wizarding battle between good and evil draws ever closer, Harry, Hermione and Ron bunk off from Hogwarts to go search for the ""Horcruxes"" with which to halt the ever stronger Voldermort and his army, on the way they learn the importance of the Deathly Hallows artifacts.

So this is the one that sees the comfort confines of Hogwarts left behind as our intrepid trio of best pals hit the mountains and forests in search of the tools to stop old snake face in his tracks. In what is ultimately a chase/escape movie, one where the characters have to fight not only a number of challenges that come their way, but also their new found in-fighting capabilities, Deathly Hallows 1 wonderfully dangles the carrot for the final series entry to come. But the overriding thoughts you come away with from it is that firstly it's not really that much fun, and secondly that it shouldn't have been a stand alone movie. Too much of it plods where exposition and padding strains to get the film through its near two and half hour running time. Without the hustle and bustle of Hogwarts, and the myriad of characters that reside within, film struggles to escape the over reliance on just three central characters and a ream of MacGuffins. While some of the comedy and tender moments fall flat because tone is firmly pitched at dark clouds a gathering. However, where it does reward is with the action sequences, with David Yates once again proving he's a considerable talent when it comes to directing such passages.

New additions to the cast list feature Rhys Ifans, Peter Mulan and Bill Nighy, all welcome, and all sadly underused. As is the return of some older characters from earlier series entries (do you remember John Hurt was in the first film?!). While the thread involving the Ministry of Magic, and its nasty transformation into a Nazi like call for non-magical folk ethnic cleansing, is supremely adult and hits the nerves as it should do. Of the three principal young adult actors, it's still Emma Watson leading the way on ability, but alongside her, Radcliffe and Grint have earned our love and respect over the years for having to carry the weight of such expectation that has come with these roles. Fact is, is that now, having grown up with them and their characters for over ten years, we surely can accept them for not being multi ranged child actors. They have had to embody one character each for a decade, the range as such is the naturalism of aging through childhood like they have. Job done!

Tension is high and the magical moments engage big time, but the draggy nature of the beast makes this a film purely working as an appetiser to something sure to be far bigger and better. 6/10"
Gimly,"Has the quality direction of _Order of the Phoenix_ but manages to separate itself from that movie by having a script that isn't shit. 

Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go."
Rahul Gupta,"Awesome moview. Best Action sequence.

**Slow in the first half**"
Frank Ochieng,"One would think that the ultimate showdown between two of the most iconic super-heroes would make for some downright compelling action-oriented exploits against a landscape of angst and destruction. Plus, it certainly did not hurt that exhilarating filmmaker Zack Snyder (‘300’) was at the helm in bringing together the colorfully and concocted confrontation between The Caped Crusader and The Man of Steel. Also, it should have been an effortless task to bring together **Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice** leading men Ben Affleck and Henry Cahill since they had prior experiences donning heroic attire as mighty super-heroes on call to save the day. So why then does Snyder’s big-budgeted connect-the-dots comic book caper feel so incoherently stiff and aimless?

The dour randomness of **Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice** is quite disappointing because this moping actioner wants to grab more than it can chew in its crowded mouth. Snyder and screenwriters David S. Goyer and Chris Terrio aspire to plug in such contemplative issues pertaining to moral ambivalence, political platitudes and religious themes but none of these factors energize or sustain this action-packed narrative that seems to slouch all at the expense of a sluggish approach to the mechanical hedonism that labors.

There is no doubt that **Dawn of Justice** has its share of visual opulence as this is obviously expected in an expansive superhero saga where the proven selling point are two mythical comic book titans spearheading the pumped-up proceedings. Again an overreaching script that plods along, a couple of super-powered sourpusses going the moody motions and the lack of carefree robust action undermine the potential explosiveness that **Dawn of Justice** could have capitalized on with dynamic aplomb.

Sure, there is a noted curiosity and interesting element about the topic of “heroism fatigue” and hidden demons that could have certainly contributed to the psychological strain for our Caped Courageous Ones. Still, **Dawn of Justice** never quite turns this premise into a sparkling case of burn-out conviction, Instead, knuckle-dragging duo of Bruce Wayne/Batman (Affleck) and Clark Kent/Superman (Cavell) make the common sleeping pill look like an excitable bag of M&M candy treats. Thankfully, another fan favorite superhero in the form of Wonder Woman (Gal Godot) is thrown into the mix to break up the monotony of the boorish Boys Club. Unfortunately, the appearance of the wily Wonder Woman during the tail end of the second half is too little and too late for her welcomed presence to rescue the film’s clunky pacing.

Gotham’s Bruce Wayne and Metropolis’s Clark Kent are experiencing setbacks that could be perceived as reaching the depressive crossroads. For starters, a maturing Wayne’s/Batman’s crime-fighting prospects have been tailing off drastically. As for Kent/Superman his existence at the Daily Planet newspaper seems mundane especially when his boss in editor Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) declares that the public has moved away from print given the major impact of social media and other online resources. So yes…Wayne and Kent are in a critical funk in their professional lives both in and out of their familiar costumes. However, can the slumping cities afford two down-and-out superheroes when one can probably carry the load in rough, unsure times?

When the film establishes the dilemma that there can be only one muscle-bound ego to handle the affairs of the region’s unprotected this is where the **Batman v Superman** portion of **Dawn of Justice** looks as if the frenetic fantasy will percolate. Inexplicably, the hype involving the sparring twosome is put on hold as the exposition takes its tedious time building up the conflict to satisfy the clashing insecurities of the capable caped crime-stoppers. For those that witnessed Cavell’s mediocre **Man of Steel** a few years ago will probably understand the current bad blood that exists between the two super studs. Whatever the case both Batman and Superman have pegged each other as brawny bad news ambassadors…something that does not sit well with either struggling superhero as their revered reputations are on the line.

Naturally, there are other outside forces to consider as the acrimonious overtones continue to flow between the brooding mega-powers. The famed instigator in Superman foe Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) is realized as the high-tech billionaire nuisance that has an underlying scheme to eradicate both bickering super powers once and for all but not before Luthor pronounces his take on philosophical tirades. In the meantime, Lois Lane (Amy Adams) is on board to profess her undying love and support for her desired dreamboat Superman. Luthor loathing Superman while Lane fantasizing about her strong flashy fly boy. In other words it is business as usual. While Superman is trying to figure out his place in the sun Snyder piles on the bothersome dreamy anxieties that plague the aging Wayne.

**Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice** is a jumbled mess. Snyder undertakes a convoluted production and tries to sell it as a sophisticated meeting of the misplaced minds between two embattled entities embroiled in uncertainty and super-sized cynicism. Still, Snyder’s vision is mishandled as he seems to have forgotten one crucial point–simply making an action movie that registers with genuine thrills. One cannot help but stumble upon the pretentiousness and piousness that ruins this boneless blockbuster. The film finally decides to stack on the combinations of boisterous match-ups involving everyone but the kitchen sink but all comes off as frivolously forced. Cavell was never really an enticing Superman ever since he donned the big “S” on his chest back in 2013’s** Man of Steel**. Affleck’s Batman is a little more palatable but the constant scowl (both on his face and on the mask) is too much to digest. One would not mind yelling at the screen for Affleck’s alter ego to lighten up a bit.

The supporting players are virtually wasted in this exhausting CGI popcorn pleaser. Eisenberg, normally a trustworthy performer with considerable scope, merely irritates as the punkish techno-magnate Luthor. The always radiant Adams is a wash as the gushing Lois Lane. Oscar-winner Jeremy Irons’s Alfred the butler won’t make anyone forget Micheal Caine’s take on Wayne’s trusty man servant anytime soon. Even the reliably adventurous Oscar-nominated actor Michael Shannon cannot exuberantly bring to life the menacing presence of Zod.

Humorless and hackneyed, **Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice** will probably satisfy indiscriminate devoted fans that will buy into the proposed heralded rivalry. As for others, they will wonder what lies ahead in terms of other League of Justice movies that hopefully can muster up more entertaining stimulation than this over-indulgent doomsday dud. Is anyone up for **Wonder Woman vs. Redwing** with an empowering feminine twist?

shekzilla,A bit slow but overall good. There are many sub plots in the movie that could've been made into independent movies of their own.
Reno,"> Know your enemy's weakness before challenging to a fight!

It is known that critics have no brain. It is the best Superman film as Henry Cavill in the red and blue suit. Yep, I know it is always DC versus Marvel, so it is then DC's reply to the 'Avengers'. I don't care their rivalries, as a film fanatic, I enjoy good films and I found it was so good. But I was a bit worried after the Superman was shown in a dark shade in the trailer, especially after Batwan was overly stylised by Nolan, I thought the black suit would take over. After watching the film I was relieved and happy that Batman was exposed.

Batman fans might have been disappointed, but for the superhero and DC fans, this film is a great treat. You can't compare it with 'Avengers', it had its own style. It follows the 'Man of Steel' and directed by the same director. Excellent cast. I have never been the Ben Affleck hater, so I had no objection to his role in this. He did good along with Cavill and others. He would do better in his solo Batman films if Zack Snyder is retained to script and direct them.

I'm not a comic book reader, so I did not know the story before the watch. I was surprised for the Wonder Woman's part in the film. The visuals were awesome, the story was unpredictable, well developed characters, cleverly composed scenes, wonderful stunt sequences and the film's overall tone was kind of dark and gloomy, a very satisfying superhero film. The content balance was perfect, but the characters did not do the same as we know Superman is a father of all superheroes.

I already watched it twice and I can't wait for its sequel. Especially looking forward for Jesse Eisenberg, because he was kind of stayed low in this and I hope his character Lex becomes much stronger. It is a PG13, and there's nothing botherable stuffs in it for the underage audience, but I felt it is targeted for adults because of the matured flavour. Don't think about that I said, just watch it, it will definitely entertain you well if not blow you away. Surely recommended to all.

Austin Singleton,"I still have faith in the DCU but this movie had problems. Watch my full review here.

Per Gunnar Jonsson,"As I write this review I have just had a thoroughly disappointing movie experience and it so just happens that I have some strong feelings about the source material for this movie so be prepared for a bit of ranting and a few more “adult” words than usual.

I have to say that I bought this movie only because I felt I wanted it in my collection just for it to be complete. I was really expecting to be, shall we say, not impressed. A movie about Batman and Superman, heroes that I grew up with, fighting is not my kind of movie.

In the end I realized that my expectations of crappines was not enough. I really disliked this movie. In short succession this movie turns several of my childhood heroes to bad guys and the greatest superman bad guy into a unstable hippie-like jerk that goes through the movie behaving like he is a drug addict. So basically this movie went drown the drains for me straight away and then I have not even gotten started about the plot. Actually I felt so annoyed over this crap that I actually spent time taking notes while I was watching.

Let me see what I noted. Lex Luther is a fucking joke. Alfred, the same. Jimmy Olsen a fucking CIA agent? You got to be fucking kidding me! And not only does he screw Lois Lane but gets himself shot after a few seconds of screen time.

Same stupid nonsense about XXX being too powerful, is a threat and needs to be government controlled that has been used in hundreds. if not thousands, of crappy low and high budget action movies. I hate that crap. It is stupid, stupid, stupid.

Weird and totally uninteresting dream scenes, what the f... did the writer smoke? If they wanted to pad the movie it a) was a crappy way of doing it and b) why? With over three hours (Ultimate Edition) it is way to long for such a crappy movie anyway.

Oh, here is a (somewhat) positive note at least. It was indeed rather funny that they had chosen CNN to spew out the nonsense conspiracy theories about Superman being responsible for the bomb in the wheelchair. Fake news anyone?

I had a little bit of enjoyment of the movie during the last part of the movie when it finally turned into a bit of action. Batman’s car and plane was cool. The action, once Batman getting knocked on his head enough to get to his senses again, was a nice chunk of CGI goodness. That I have to admit.

Okay, after three, mostly painful, hours the movie finally comes to an end. And what an end. Meh!!! Not only was it a crappy ending but they managed to drag it out forever with excruciatingly boring scenes.

I am sure a lot of the above can be said to be subjective. For instance my dislike of the way my childhood characters where treated. I am not a professional reviewer though so this is my personal take of the movie. If you don’t like it, fine with me and good for you but do not feel obliged to tell me about it."
TheTenth,"Very short synopsis : Batman has been hit hard by the events of Man of Steel : a ""god"" descends on earth, is confronted by another god, and they fight, killing thousands of humans. He learns about a rock coming from his birth planet that can weaken or kill him. It's the property of Lex Luthor, who could target Superman too, but with evil purpose.

So I won't go deeper in the story. This movie, unlike most other superhero movie, is targeting adults. I don't mean 18 or 21 year old, I mean mature beings that have endured bad things in life, and have taken the time to see the goods and bads of humanity. Yes, not the Marvel (Guardians of the galaxy, Ant man) target audience. Batman makes it clear (rejoined by the senator) : if a being is so powerful he can't be killed and can kill thousands, even if for now he does good, what happens if he becomes a villain? What laws or weapons can stop him?

Now going back to the movie and how it presents its argument. We have Batman's introduction to the new DC movie universe (death of parents, tortured psyche ...) done during the opening credits. That is both efficient and powerful. Then we see Bruce Wayne at the time of the Superman / Zod battle. We also see humans being scared and killed. So, yeah it's superhero movie making not showing merry world with superheroes saving humans. And doing funny quotes. It's people (or super people) facing tragedy and growing up to see how the future has to be settled. And then a new villain appears. Or rather, he appears as a careless billionnaire showing off - how could he be perceived as dangerous? He has the chance of having Batman wanting to take down Superman, when he wants the same thing, so he can go for his secondary plan to use Krypton technology to change the world.

So the last part of the movie is the fight of 3 super heroes against a creature created by the ""god""'s technology and humanity's madness/evilness. Yes, it's not a villain that is there because you need one to fight the bad guys, it's yet another consequence of Kryptonians coming to earth.

So the films rolls out and I'm so stunned by the content I feel I was treated as a human being, not as a popcorn eating teenager or a comics fan. Just as someone that could appreciate great movie making."
Peter89Spencer,"I don't understand the hate people had with this film. I thought it was brilliant.
Sure, I had my doubts of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, but halfway through the end those doubts were put to rest.
And Ben Affleck was amazing as the latest incarnation of Batman. It was a long time since the actor did a superhero movie (Daredevil).
My only critique was Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal as Lex Luthor - really cringing for me. Didn't do justice for the character (no pun intended)! Michael Fassbender would've been a more suitable role.

Anyway, this film...it was a Zack Snyder masterpiece."
mooney240,"**Zack Snyder creates an entire DC universe in one film filled with gritty new takes on familiar characters and brutal action.**

I know this is a polarizing thing to say, but I loved this movie! I think Zack Snyder crushed it with the incredible production design, off-the-charts casting, and gritty take on a lost and weary Batman. The casting for this movie is a master stroke of brilliance. Ben Affleck’s Batman is jaded and bitter, taking his rage and loss out on the criminal element of Gotham. His hulking physique emphasizes Batman’s imposing strength over his gadgets when in combat. Zack Snyder also gave us Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, which we all know is one of the best choices in the comic book cinema world. The fight sequences are the best part of BvS; pitting godlike power against a man motivated by grief somehow seems possible and brutal because of Snyder’s writing and directing. Finally, the world-building and teases bring so much intrigue and excitement for future films. It isn’t a perfect film, but as a DC and Batman fan, it is one of my favorite comic book movies and stands out as refreshingly separate from all the bright-colored goofy Marvel movies of the time."
Jacob Piszar,"**Watch the Ultimate Edition!**

The first of several DC movies to suffer from WB forcing a mediocre cut of a great film. Before the Snyder Cut there was the Ultimate Edition, Snyder's vision is better presented here in a longer, darker, and more sensible cut of this film."
Wuchak,"***The Passion of the Christ, I mean Superman***

Superman returns to Earth after five years trying to find out what happened to his homeworld. As Clark Kent he gets his job back at the Daily Planet newspaper, but finds out Lois Lane has moved on without him -- having a live-in fiancé and a five-year-old child, not to mention winning a Pulitzer for her article ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman."" Meanwhile Lex Luthor and his henchmen discover Superman's Fortress of Solitude and steal some of the alien crystals. Luthor's mad scheme is to create a new continent, killing billions of people in the process.

The story is a superhero retelling of the Christ story:

- Jor-el gives his only son to protect (save) humankind. 
- Superman repeatedly states that he's everywhere and will always be around (i.e. omnipresent). 
- Luthor and his henchmen's beating of Supes is reminiscent of Christ's beating before his crucifixion. 
- Superman sacrifices himself to save humanity from Luthor's new continent. 
- When superman ""dies"" above the atmosphere of Earth he is shown in a cross posture.

Meanwhile Lois Lane is an obvious type of atheism. Although she once believed in and even loved Superman, she's now convinced the world doesn't really need him. She's obviously unhappy and bitter; she lacks the pizazz she had when she once believed.

Of course, all this heavy symbolism is useless if the story itself fails to capture the viewer's attention. This is especially vital when the picture runs 2 hours and 34 minutes. 

The film definitely has an epic vibe to it, even more so than the first in the series. It seems more serious, i.e. less campy, especially where Luthor and his team are concerned. The film also possesses an imperceptible reverent quality. Even though the whole Superman mythos is totally absurd, the film somehow enables the viewer to accept it as real. On top of all this there are numerous humorous bits, which are laugh-out-loud funny (watch out for the hilarious ""It's a bird,"" ""It's a plane"" piece).

Other things worth commenting on:

- Some complain that Kate Bosworth lacks charisma as Lois Lane, but this all fits into the bitter ""I no longer believe"" subplot. Bosworth is fine in the role. 
- Some complain about Superman's 5-year visit to Krypton. What's the problem? Part of my youth was spent in Minneapolis and I've gone back there numerous times to quell my curiosity. Why wouldn't Superman feel the same way? Why was he gone so long and why did he need a crystalized craft? Because he was potentially exposing himself to large amounts of Kryptonite (radioactive pieces of his homeworld) which would severely weaken him, not to mention he gets his powers from the Earth's sun. 
- Some complain about Lois' fiancé and her son, the latter of whom may or may not be the offspring of Supes. Wouldn't it be natural for Lois to move on after about two years waiting? Her ""shacking up"" before marriage can be attributed to her new ""I no longer believe"" mentality. 
- Love is a strong theme here as is fitting for any retelling of the Christ story. Superman loves Lois and vice versa, even though Lois is initially in denial. Love gives life and saves from death. 
- I liked the fact that Lois' fiancé, Richard (Marsden), isn't made out to be a villain. Interestingly, Lois picked a man who, as a pilot, could fly her around like Supes, albeit less spectacularly. I also like the fact that the film shows Lois being faithful to Richard even though she discovers she still loves Superman. The human heart is capable of loving more than one person, but can only be faithful or committed to one, if you know what I mean. 
- Frank Langella is his usual charismatic self as Perry White. 
- Kevin Spacey is excellent as Luthor and arguably superior to Hackman; this is especially evident as the story progresses. His larger-than-life lunatic scheme is truly fitting for Supe's main foe. 
- There are numerous dramatic parts where the film takes its time to tell the story; there's obviously no rush to get to the next CGI action scene. Those with ADD beware. Needless to say, this is a film for adults even though kids will enjoy many aspects. 
- ""Superman Returns"" was one of the most expensive films ever made at $209 million but made most of it back in North America ($200 million) while almost doubling it worldwide ($392 million). What's strange is studio heads were disappointed with these numbers, claiming it should have made $500 million.

BOTTOM LINE: I was surprised to discover how good ""Superman Returns"" is. This is an epic and moving superhero film; sci-fi/fantasy at its best. Is it as good or better than the best superhero films? Not only is it as good, it's deeper.

GRADE: A-"
John Chard,"The light to show the way. 

After a five year hiatus, Superman returns to Earth to find that Lois Lane is now a soon to be married mother, but some things don't change, loony Lex Luthor is loose and his latest plan will kill billions of people.

I first reviewed Superman Returns some two years after its initial release, I had first caught it on release back in 2006 and was really taken with Bryan Singer's approach to a subject he clearly loves. I was awash with nostalgic fervour back then and the moment the theme tune kicked in (great move by Singer to use the John Williams original) I was grinning like a Cheshire cat, yet it seemed I was in a minority back then as regards the film's worth, and with each passing year I find I still am.

Superman Returns will forever be known as the franchise entry that has too much heart, because it finds Singer giving Superman emotional fortitude and, crucially, making it the heart of the story. Those that purely wanted a big colourful popcorn explosion will forever be unfulfilled it seems. Yet it has to be said that fans of Singer's work (such as I) totally get the emotionally heavy approach he has taken, watching Superman shred himself after learning of Lois' love for another, makes for compulsive viewing. Because our man of steel is conflicted, not only with his sense of protective being, but also in the rigours of love, it's this conflict of Superman that drives the film on. Not to say that there isn't any action here, though, in fact some of the sequences here are truly exhilarating. Oh yes, the popcorn crowd are well catered for, planes, space shuttles and a tension filled helicopter, all figure in and around Superman and Luthor's world.

Brandon Routh dons the cape worn so brilliantly by Christopher Reeve in the 70s, and smartly Routh takes the route of ""if it isn't broke then don't fix it"", there's no need to put ones own stamp on a character already so well defined and well loved. Looking like Reeve, and playing out uncannily like him, Routh studied Reeve's performances to get as close to the Reeve incarnation as he could, and he gets it down pat whilst adding a bit of brooding honesty into the mix. Kate Bosworth gets to be Lois Lane, it's a very solid and controlled performance that would have seen her as a shoe in for the role again if Singer had of taken the reins for a sequel. Taking up the role of Lex Luthor, and clearly having a great time, is Kevin Spacey, this is a more clever Luthor incarnation, it's spiteful and devoid of campery. While along for the ride as Luthor's moll is Parker Posey, she's sparky with a hint of devilish sexiness.

Bryan Singer reinvigorated the Superman franchise, and in doing so brought a new verve to the characterisation of an American icon. It has proved to be divisive amongst the fans and critics alike, so much so that Singer has left the Superman world. But viewing it even now brings many rewards, it is a damn fine Superman movie. You can never have too much heart at your film's core, that is as long as one remembers what made prior efforts work in the first place, Singer did to my mind fuse both very admirably indeed. 8/10"
Potential Kermode,"**It's a shame that they did this to the Bond films**

It's upsetting for Bond fans that Eon productions ran away from the lively, fun formula that sustained the franchise for 40 years. What does it leave us with? Well - this type of Bond film unfortunately. Staggeringly bland and uninteresting.  If we removed the name Bond from the film we would have no idea that we were watching a Bond movie. 

It is depressing that they flushed 40 years of fun Bond films down the toilet to satiate people who dislike classic Bond adventures. They reached for a wider audience by going all generic action film to the detriment of the Bond legacy.

Who is this unsophisticated, short, blond man in the suit? Unfortunately, _he could be anyone_ - even you or I. Bond is now a lager chugging everyman. Ian Fleming would be furious.

No chance of Craig's Bond wearing  _a strap on plastic seagull hat_ as Connery did in the classic Goldfinger (1964) - they would not dare make the films that fun and entertaining anymore.

It's a shame what they did to the Bond films."
John Chard,"If we refused to do business with villains, we'd have almost no one to trade with!

Quantum of Solace is directed by Marc Forster and written by Paul Haggis, Neil Purvis and Robert Wade, suggested from the stories written by Ian Fleming. It stars Daniel Craig, Olga Kurylenko, Mathieu Amalric, Judi Dench, Giancarlo Giannini, Gemma Arteton & Jeffrey Wright. It is the 22nd film of the James Bond series.

Following on straight from Casino Royale, we find James Bond thirsting for revenge on those he believes responsible for Vesper Lynd's death.

Is Quantum Of Solace a great action film? Yes it surely is, is it however a great James Bond picture? Not quite, apparently, given the often venomous reaction to it from some Bond fan quarters. You wonder if Quantum Of Solace is a victim of Casino Royale's soaring success? A film that even surprised the many Daniel Craig haters. Were these internet warriors preying for a bad Bond film purely to further their argument that Craig should not be Bond? Did QOS give them smug satisfaction? Actually no it didn't, the box office and longevity of professional critiques proves this fact. Further viewings of QOS show it to be very astute in the Bond universe, where much of the charges of it not being fun enough etc just do not stick. As for not being Bondian enough? Opening car chase, a pursuit on foot that ends in a quite exhilarating rope dangle punch up, speedboat chaos, aeroplane peril with free-falling! Not Bond enough? Seriously? While it's also great to see Bond active on a motorcycle again.

The Casino Royale rebooted and re-suited offering was popular because it had an earthy make over, Daniel Craig's Bond is a fallible human being brimming with egotistical ruggedness. It's much of the same here in Quantum, where he is forced to go rouge, something that again has proved to be an itchy narrative thrust with sections of the Bond faithful. Yet as serious as he is, driven by pangs of annoyance, revenge and unanswered questions, Bond does have time to lay out a quip, there is some fun stuff their, honestly, Mother. Personally I enjoy the dark half of this Bond, ""I don't have any friends"", he wouldn't care"", and ""how many is that now?"", these are moments nearly as good as the interwoven opera blood bath and Bond drinking away his demons with 6 high velocity cocktails. Then there is Craig. Ah, Craig, Daniel Craig, again perfect in the tux and kicking arse with streetwise credibility, each scar on his nicely formed body a testament to this new rugged Bond of the people. That he rises above a relatively muddling script is testament to not only his acting ability, but also his new found acceptance in this most iconic of cinematic roles amongst the British institution that is James Bond.

The rest of the cast are a mixed bunch, Jeffrey Wright & Giancarlo Giannini are again merely making up the numbers, though the last gets to give Bond one of the film's darkest and cold inducing moments. Judi Dench of course does her usual solid M performance, swearing and growing the balls she hinted at previously, while Olga Kurylenko is very much a sparky Bond girl to savour; even if the sub-plot involving her almost feels like it was shoe-horned into the script as an added extra. Elsewhere there are problems. Casino Royale, had on the surface a weak villain, a man merely playing cards to pay off a more evil source, but he was effective. Sadly here in the Quantam universe the main villain is a hindrance to the picture. Mathieu Amalric's Dominic Greene does a good line in smarmy, but he's so weak the film nearly crumbles under the weight of his banality. The people at the house of Bond need to realise that little fish villains are only OK if we get the big daddy shark showing his/her face later in proceedings, for if this trend continues I fear the franchise could well lose the edge so well built up in Royale, and Gemma Arteton is pretty, but pretty ineffective. The locations are sumptuous, mind, and the sets are Bondian delights, with the title sequence certainly hitting the spot in spite of the quite dreadful Jack Black and Alcia Keys' theme song that accompanies the sequence. A homage to a former great Bond film sequence is respectful but a touch lazy, but QOS still overcomes its failings to be up above many action pictures of the last decade; this in spite of it being very slim line at an hour and 45 in length. Crucially, though, it pulses with Bond aggression and egotistical nous, just as Fleming wanted it. But this only comes out with further viewings...

Skyfall will be the next venture for Bond, regardless of quality we know that it will fail to appease every Bond fan on the planet. That's just the way it is with the series, so many want so many different things from their Bond. But I feel this is a good period for Bond, they do have the right man wearing the tux and as a character he is well tuned into the times, both politically and cinematically, it's now up to the makers to fuse the two and deliver a film to fully realise the rebooted franchise's potential and maybe, just maybe, win the dissenters' trust. 7/10"
DanDare,"Quantum of Solace had to follow Casino Royale which rebooted the Bond franchise with critics as well as with some of the public with a youthful, angry Bond.

Quantum of Solace starts 20 minutes after the events of Casino Royale with a fast edited but choppy car chase sequence. This is the first hint that Bond is following the Bourne films as co-editor Richard Pearson previously edited one of the Bourne films. This also highlights director's Marc Forster inexperience in making action films as many of the action sequences are hard to follow because of the way it has been edited.

The film was also hampered by the 2008 writer's strike. This meant that film went into production without a full working script which also meant that the director and even Daniel Craig allegedly wrote scenes for the film. It might explain the short running time.

The film unveils Quantum as a shady organisation with tentacles everywhere even in the heart of the British security services. The setting in Bolivia with disputes about water gives the film a political edge with a cynical look at corporations making dicey alliances with dictatorships to mutually exploit the people and plunder resources.

Forster gives the film some intriguing set pieces such the opera scene which is the meeting point for Quantum operatives which Bond infiltrates.

The short running time means the film is not overblown but with Craig at the helm it is kept lean and mean."
JPV852,"Probably liked this a bit more than the last time I saw this ('08 or '09) but still a sizable step down from Casino Royale, although I do appreciate that this is a direct sequel (whereas it seems most Bond movies are standalone). The plot isn't the best nor is the villain, albeit Mathieu Amalric does have the creep-factor going for him. The action sequences are good but not enough quieter moments.

Plus, the (kind of) twist at the end regarding Vesper really cheapened that character, having her being duped like that, seems out of character given how perceptive she was with Bond.

In any case, still a solid enough movie as a whole and I absolutely love Olga Kuryenko, shame she never really took off. **3.25/5**"
Wuchak,"_**Decent Bond flick marred by ridiculous quick-editing**_

Bond seeks justice for the death of his woman in the previous film as well as those responsible for an assassination attempt on M (Judi Dench). The trail leads from mountainous northern Italy to the rooftops of Siena, Italy, to London to Haiti and finally to the secluded desert of Bolivia and Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), a world-renowned developer of green technology. Greene is intent on securing a barren area of Bolivia in exchange for assisting General Medrano stage a coup there (Joaquín Cosio). Since the CIA looks the other way, only 007 stands in Greene's way with assistance from a retired spy and two formidable beauties (Olga Kurylenko and Gemma Arterton). M wonders if she can trust Bond or if his need for vengeance has corrupted him.

Released in 2008, ""Quantum of Solace"" is the second of five Bond films with Daniel Craig as Agent 007. Craig makes for a unique James Bond and I appreciate the serious vibe of his installments.

The problem with ""Quantum of Solace,"" the 23nd Bond film (if you count 1983's non-Eon ""Never Say Never Again""), is the rapid-fire editing during the action scenes. Take, for instance, the opening chase-sequence that takes place on the tollway that leads through mountain tunnels from Nice through Monte Carlo and down to Portofino in Italy. It's a spectacularly scenic area. Unfortunately you won't see much of it here, just quick flashes; more importantly, you'll hardly understand what's going on due to the moronic fast editing. The camera switches about 3 or 4 times per second! I'm sure the filmmakers think such quick angle changes convey energy, but when it's done this fast all it does is confuse, disorient and ANNOY the viewer. It wouldn't be so bad if this was the only sequence like this but, no, after Bond's initial meeting with M (Judi Dench) there's another ridiculous rapid-fire action scene.

The filmmakers need to get a grip that James Bond is not a mindless action hero. He's too smart for that; he's the ultimate 'cool' attitude. Violence for him is an irritation resorted to only when necessary. He exists for the mental play, the checkmate and, later, the martini, shaken, not stirred; the beautiful woman too, of course. The only way the average viewer can successfully make it past the 25-minute mark of ""Quantum of Solace"" and enjoy the movie is if s/he drinks a pot of heavily-caffeinated coffee beforehand. If you do this it's an entertaining Bond picture with some effective sequences, like when Bond and Camille find themselves stuck in the remote desert after surviving a thrilling aerial combat, plus Olga (Camille) and Gemma (Strawberry Fields) are top-of-the-line, but the annoying quick-editing in the action scenes heavily mars the flick and prevents it from being in the top tier of the franchise.

The film runs 1 hour, 46 minutes, and was shot in England, Italy, Austria, Spain, Panama (standing in for Haiti), Chili (the Atacama Desert) and Baja California (the last two standing in for Bolivia).

MSB,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/quantum-of-solace-spoiler-free-review

""Quantum of Solace is one of the biggest disappointments of the respective decade, holding a titanic drop in quality compared to its predecessor. Daniel Craig's dedicated performance isn't enough to save an over-violent James Bond flick, packed with terribly handled action sequences - shaky cam and quick cuts may be the worst technical combo in cinema - and an uninspiring, utterly boring narrative. Both the villain and the new Bond girls return to being easily forgettable cliches. Despite boasting the shortest runtime of the entire franchise, I couldn't wait for this unexpectedly poor sequel to reach its underwhelming ending. A stain that the next installment would fortunately clean…""

Rating: D"
CinemaSerf,"Whilst there is certainly loads of action in this rather procedural outing for ""James Bond"" (a rather uncharismatic Daniel Craig) there is a real dearth of a substantial story. Picking up from ""Casino Royale"" (2006), this film sees our super-spy capture elusive ""Mr White"" (Jesper Christiansen) only to have him escape in the most treacherous of fashions - putting all in MI6 at risk. Pretty quickly, ""007"" is on the trail of the ostensibly benign millionaire ""Greene"" (Mathieu Amalric) and as the escapades gather pace we realise that the industrialist has a cunning plan to manipulate a crime consortium of global proportions; to take over the government of Bolivia and to control the ebb and flow of one of that nation's most crucial resources. Thing is, though, that this is all just too weak. The story is just lacklustre and undercooked. The efforts of the baddies - Amalric, Anatole Taubman as henchman ""Elvis"" and a straight-from-central-casting Joaquín Cosio as the scheming ""Gen. Medrano"" just to don't create any sense of menace or peril. Far too much time is spent swinging from scaffolding, or trashing a rather impressive set for a performance of ""Tosca"" rather than creating a solid story with twists and turns. Again, the character of ""M"" (Dame Judi Dench) has much more of a role, and sacrilegious as it may be, she just isn't very good at it. She seemed to be wearing the same clothes for most of her scenes, too! The dialogue is rather dry, no fun innuendo or double-entendre and though quite spunky, Olga Kurylenko is no natural as ""Camille"", a girl with an axe to grind (ideally into the general's skull). It ends a bit like ""Licence to Kill"" (1989) and, indeed, is all just a bit too much of an hybrid of the other films to offer much by way of distinction. Good to see an Aston Martin back on screen, but otherwise this rather curiously titled film offers very little to write home about."
jw,"I'll make it quick. I watched this movie, and after some while I realised, I had seen this one before.

It's so forgettable, you can skip it without loss. Expect disappointment if you do watch it. It's just a run-off-the-mill action flick, basically."
John Chard,"Wrong Brother.

The early signs were not good, tales of production problems galore and
early critical notices wading in to kick the film before it had even
had a run at the theatres. The Lone Ranger seemed destined to be a
blockbuster stinker. Yet in spite of it noticeably alienating original
Lone Ranger purists, and some Western lovers as well, for a rollicking
action fun packed time then Gore Verbinski's movie delivers in spades. 

It's awash with the serial silliness of adventure films and TV shows of
yore, pitching good guys against bad guys with buddy buddy shenanigans
pulsing away at the core. The stunts are outrageously enjoyable, the
landscape photography as beautiful as it is respectful in homage to
past masters of the Western genre, while in Depp's Tonto there's a bona
fide hero to root for just as much as he makes you laugh out loud. 

This is an origin story, a tale of how John Reid (Armie Hammer) became
The Lone Ranger, and of course how the noble steed Silver and Indian
side-kick Tonto became integral to his villain fighting ways. Tom
Wilkinson and William Fitchner file in for polar opposite villain
duties, the former is the weasel business man trying to mould the West
in is own image, the latter a repugnant psychopath with a penchant for
eating human hearts! Then Helena Bonham Carter wanders in from some
Grindhouse movie for a couple of cameos that are resplendent with
sexual energy. 

It's all very wacky and wild, and rightly so, but this is not at the
expense of very good story telling. Some parts of the narrative could
have been trimmed, but as the bromance builds between our two heroes,
and Silver gets up to all sorts of comedy horse escapades, there's nary
a dull moment here. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Verbinski
throw all the action staples into the pot. Chases, fights, swinging
from ropes, shoot-outs, people dangling from speeding train (pic is
bookended by awesome train sequences), grisly deaths and on it goes
from start to end. 

There's caustic asides to the machinations of organisations of the
time, from railroad magnates to the cavalry, while the catchphrases and
legends of The Lone Ranger TV series are deftly inserted into the tale.
It was interesting to see Depp come out and defend the movie against
those damning early critic reviews, it's not something he does, being
as he is very much a guy who sees acting as just a job. Bruckheimer,
Hammer and Verbinski backed Depp up, stating that some reviews were
written before the film had even been released, the big budget and
production problems clearly making this a big stinker… 

Not so, it's certainly not flawless, and those seriously into
anachronisms are likely to have kittens. But if you haven't seen it
yet, if you was put off by the venomous early reviews, then give it a
chance, you may just be surprised at just how entertaining it is. It
also looks and sounds brilliant on Blu-ray, where repeat viewings even
show Hammer to be better than first thought as that masked man. 8.5/10"
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"If this film would not have been called Lone Ranger and would not have pretended to tell the story the Lone Ranger then I would probably have considered it to be an okay movie. Maybe even a good one. However, this was supposed to be a Lone Ranger movie and that it is not!

I put this movie in the same category as the very disappointing Green Hornet movie. It is a typical case of some dumbass Hollywood producer/director taking a known name and thinks he can do what the heck he wants with it. The Lone Ranger is supposed to be the only survivor of a group of rangers, a hero as well as intelligent and so is Tonto. In this movie the Lone Ranger is a bloody lawyer, he is naïve and generally a screw up. Tonto is, well, as looney as one could expect with Jonny Depp in the role.

It is really said when you feel the best characters in the movie are the bad guys. I think Butch Cavendish is quite nicely portrayed by William Fichtner. Okay, the movie have its fun moments, a few laughs, some nice special effects and is not really poorly done as such. Unfortunately a lot of the time I phrases like “what and idiot”, “what the f…”, “this is not Lone Ranger” and so on, went through my head while watching it.

If this is the first time you have heard about the Lone Ranger, or you do not really care if the movie has anything to do with the original Lone Ranger then you probably will find this an entertaining movie. I am afraid that I was hugely disappointed."
Gimly,"(I wrote a very long and comprehensive review about this but I lost it in a browser crash so we'll have to make do with just one paragraph).

Watching _The Lone Ranger_, every now and then, I could genuinely see the spark of a good movie trying its darndest to shine through. With a lot of changes, (foremost amongst them, a change of cast in the two leads) this might have been something special, I really can see how it could have been. But that wasn't the movie we got. We got this, and it is very disappointing.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
r96sk,"It loses its way a bit at around the midway point, but all in all <em>'The Lone Ranger'</em> is a film I found entertainment in.

No doubt helped by much of the people behind 2003's <em>'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'</em> - my favourite film - reuniting for this. From Johnny Depp to Gore Verbinski to Jerry Bruckheimer to Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio. Therefore, I was bound to like it.

Depp is enjoyable, as is usually the case. There are, of course, question marks as to whether he's 'right' for the role. He claims he has Native American heritage, though you enter a real grey area with all that stuff. Anyway, judging by his acting, he's fun. Armie Hammer is much better than I thought he'd be, while William Fichtner makes for a good villain. Nice to see Ruth Wilson and Helena Bonham Carter involved, also.

I like the way the story is told, involving Depp and Mason Cook. It certainly adds a sense of intrigue to events. The end scenes are also enjoyable, at least visually - I don't love the score all that much, to be honest. However, as noted at the top, the middle part of the film is less entertaining - though the finale helps pick things back up.

I've, evidently, seen better from these lot. Still, it's a very good film in my books; despite having issues."
CinemaSerf,"Relegated to a fun-fair exhibit, ""Tonto"" (Johnny Depp) regales a young visitor with tales of his adventures with the eponymous, somewhat green and naive, lawyer ""John Reid"" (Armie Hammer). It all started when ""Tonto"" rescues ""Reid"" after he was ambushed by the nasty ""Butch Cavendish"" (William Fichtner). Together with his famed white horse they now set out to right this wrong and bring this evil man to justice. What now ensues just isn't very good. It's a sort of loosely hung together series of escapades with the easy enough on the eye Hammer just far too lightweight to bring even a modicum of charisma to the role. Depp is just recreating his ""Jack Sparrow"" characterisation - just with a white pained face; and the adventure elements are predictable and frankly rather dull. It has an almost slapstick nature to it; the dialogue tries to be pithy but in the end depends too much on the style of delivery from Depp - and I found that style repetitive and unimaginative. It culminates quite entertainingly, to be fair, but this film is just way too dependant on one single character and it just didn't work well for me. At just shy of 2½ hours, it is far too long too. Maybe 45 minutes less with more emphasis on the action and a better screenplay might have helped, but as it is - this is a long, empty, watch that borders on the spoof. Fans of Depp may well disagree, but for the rest of us this is merely a vehicle for him - and not a very good one at that."
KCruz88,"Overall this movie is great! It has flaws but it still delivered.  For instance, they didn't really explore the loving side of Superman that is the reason for saving humans.  But i get it that this could just be a different interpretation of his motives. The relationship between Clark and Lois was almost spontaneous and didn't really develop. Not to mention there was so much action! Sure this is Superman and he deserves a big movie, but that action is just so mind numbing and distracts from the plot. I really did like how they explored Clarks childhood just enough to give justification to his emotions. Although there are criticism about the ending, I thought it was well made. Clark spent his entire youth listening to his father to control himself and he had to learn to make a tough decision. I think this movie has a lot of potential for a sequel if they do it right. I look forward to being able to look back on this and watch it as part of a trilogy and not a stand alone film."
Andres Gomez,"The cast is well chosen but the Amy Adams as Lois Lane. Not that she performances bad but she is just not Lois Lane.

Smart choosing to focus in Krypton. Probably, the less repeated story told about Superman.

You can really feel Christopher Nolan's touch in the script and, probably, that's the problem. It is just too similar to Batman Begins. Also, the script repeats Batman's stupidities like the way in which Klark Kent father dies or feeling that Crowe, Superman's father, has everything under control, even his own stupid death.

Tons of FX with incredible fights that may feel exhausting for some but that I think are totally justified in this character.

The OST is again in the hands of Hans Zimmer that keeps abusing of the drumming and grave sounds.

All in all, still looking forward for the next movie of this reboot."
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"I guess I am being stubbornly traditional here but this was not really the Superman that I grow up with. I am sure that a lot of people are not going to agree with me on this one but personally I was not overly thrilled with this movie.

Sure, if what you wanted was a wild action ride and unchecked destruction then this movie will most likely satisfy you. However, as a “Superman” movie it just did not feel right to me.

The original story is tweaked and tinkered with too much. The Kryptonians, not only General Zod and his minions, are portrayed in a quite negative light. Superman himself project a hugely negative aura. Lois Lane gets to meet Superman and learn who he really is before he even starts to work for The Daily Planet. And so on and so forth…

The first part of the movie with the back-flashes, with Kal-El just trying to hide, getting bullied etc. is just sad and even boring. It is not until General Zod arrives that things starts to get going. However even then they continue to tinker with things. Apparently it is now enough to breathe Krypton-like air for him to lose his powers. This is just so wrong. Actually, the entire bla bla when they try to “explain” his powers is just dumb. There is an established story behind Superman. Even though it is fantastic and unscientific just stick to it. It is a fantasy comic character after all. Leave it at that. The story itself is not bad but it is not Superman.

Having said all that, when the fighting starts, the special effects and the action definitely have a high “coolness factor”. Superman and General Zod wrecks more havoc than half a dozen Godzillas with a bad case of hangover. Actually the level of mayhem is bordering on the ridiculous but it was fun to watch. Unfortunately I have to admit that this was my enjoyment of this movie, to watch the special effects."
Peter89Spencer,"When I first saw the trailer, I was a little excited.

Man of Steel is the first of many films of what would now be known as DCEU. 

Zack Snyder did a really brilliant job directing this movie - it was amazing! Henry Cavill was superb as Superman and Michael Shannon was brilliant as Zod. And a hat tip to Russell Crowe's performance.

The best superhero film in 2013."
citizen226,"Reading other reviews, I can understand how people that grew up with the comics didn't like it.  I never grew up with the comics.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It gets a lot of hate.  I thought the story, pacing, acting, and special effects were all excellent.  The scene where he learns to fly is one of the greatest scenes in modern cinema, in my opinion.  Gives me goosebumps every time."
r96sk,"A definitive downgrade on the first film, but this sequel still entertains to a good level.

<em>'The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian'</em> is a suitably entertaining production, if not an exceptional one; though it's not far off. I like the fresh new story and the fact that all four of the youngsters remain, but the change from dark, snowy settings to plain, summer-like conditions means the film does lose some spark. There's also much less intrigue with the villains.

Georgie Henley (Lucy), William Moseley (Peter), Anna Popplewell (Susan) and Skandar Keynes (Edmund) are again enjoyable in their roles. Liam Neeson, just barely, reprises his role of Aslan - his inclusion does feel forced, as great a character as he is.

Away from those four, you have a number of new faces. Ben Barnes (Caspian), Peter Dinklage (Trumpkin), Warwick Davis (Nikabrik) and Eddie Izzard (Reepicheep) are my standouts. Barnes is solid, I liked watching Caspian. Dinklage is great, while Davis and Izzard are welcomed newbies. Like the first film, the casting here is done astutely.

They definitely should've shortened this though, the ending does drag a fair bit. There's also a couple of different moments that feel like the end, yet evidently aren't - there's certainly more than a few pacing issues.

With all that said, I still had a more than decent time watching."
xenocast,"With a movie like this you wonder how all of the otherwise, main characters will work together and support the story.

No problems here.  While as might be expected, R. Downey Jr. comes across largely central, it is still a good mix and IMHO the best scenes in the movie involve the generated Hulk character.

With that kind of successful melding of characters, Hollywood-scale egos and even computer generated characters; you have to give it up to the writers and director to make this the successful film that it is."
Gimly,"**A long format review from 2012**

My new favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe film, undoubtedly! Order goes thusly;

1. The Avengers
2. Iron Man
3. Thor
4. Captain America
5. Iron Man 2
6. The Incredible Hulk

I had the privilege of going to Sydney and watching this almost a full three weeks before it’s American release, in a special advance screening for fans and a handful of critics. I drove up and back on a day trip with my mate HRV, spent over $400 between us… So worth it.

I think perhaps my expectations of The Avengers were too high. In fact I know they were, even so, I feel that it almost managed to meet them. All but two of the fears I had about this epic were quashed without a doubt. I initially was worried about Mark Ruffalo helming the role of The Hulk/Bruce Banner after taking over from Edward Norton who was ousted after his first appearance. My complaints were completely unfounded however, as Mark Ruffalo presents us with an at least as good Marvel Hero. 

In terms of entertainment, The Avengers is one of the greatest feats ever produced. At the screening I went to, I actually missed more than a couple of lines due to the fact that the entire bloody cinema was in hysterics from some classic Joss Whedon (Director - Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Dollhouse) humour. The squabbles between these larger than life characters are not quite up to the peak that Jon Favreau’s Iron Man & Iron Man 2 sit on, but in terms of film in general, they are some of the better interactions I’ve ever seen.

The only weak points I really have to whinge about are both quite minor, and perhaps can be rectified in the MCU future. Firstly, Thor’s return to Earth (whilst brilliantly dramatic and pretty) was quite weak in terms of exposition. That said, this isn’t a Thor movie, so we don’t need to know everything that happens to him. Also, in next year’s Thor 2, it is very possible we’ll discover more specific details about the first few scenes of his return. Secondly, Loki’s army also came across to me quite weakly. In case we have any Marvel aficionados in the crowd, I won’t spoil it by telling you who they’re supposed to be, but in general the whole army was essentially a meat shield used to bump out scenes in which The Avengers get to kick ass. A very enjoyable part of the film, but one that doesn’t really drive the story at all.

I feel the only way I can adequately describe just how much you need to see this movie (in cinemas) is this: For those of you who understand me, you will be know and be aware of just how much I fucking hate the concept of Blu-Ray. I am going to buy a Blu-Ray player, a HD television, and Blu-Ray discs, just so that I will get more special features when The Avengers is released. Never have I even considered doing such a thing before.

The Avengers doesn’t get into your mind and rape it in the best way possible like Revolver or Donnie Darko. It doesn’t get into your guts and turn them with nostalgic violence like the brilliance in Doomsday or Outpost. It gets into your heart, and leaves you not just wanting, but needing more. Long live the MCU!

Per Gunnar Jonsson,"After the recent disappointments from Marvel, notably Thor and the abysmal second instalment of Ghost Rider, this was a pleasant experience.

The special effects are dazzling, the plot is acceptable and the heroes are not making total idiots out of themselves just because the director wanted some “depth” to their characters. Sure there is a little bickering in between them but not too much to distract from the fun.

I’ve always liked Robert Downey Jr’s portrayal of Tony Stark and his sharp tongue. I did wonder how they where going to get the Hulk in there since he’s supposed to be uncontrollable but they did it. Okay they downplayed his uncontrollability a bit but I can live with that. I absolutely loved the “puny god” scene (if you haven’t seen the film yet you’ll have to see it to know what I mean, I wont spoil it in advance).

I have to say that I found Thor himself a bit underwhelming again though. I just expect something more imposing as the good of thunder. But then I’m Scandinavian so…

Anyway, this was a great film. I enjoyed it very much."
tmdb44006625,"One of the few movies to actually make me feel like a kid again, Joss Whedon was the perfect filmmaker to do this film. Everyone gets their time to shine. The script juggles every plot point and character moment with clarity and ease. It's funny, smart, and visually jaw dropping. Definitely lived up to the five movie hype."
E.J. Cummings,"I give this 10 Stars based on it being not only better than the trailer and the hype made me thing it would be, but also that it was the first time anything the size and scope of the Marvel Cinematic universe was pulled off successfully. Having Joss direct this movie lives and dies on character interaction. This movie is on the definitive list in my opinion even just for that."
John Chard,"Everything that's happening, the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old fashioned.

The Avengers (AKA: Avengers Assemble) is written and directed by Joss Whedon, with Zak Penn co-writing the story. It stars Robert Downey Junior, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddlestone, Clark Gregg, Samuel L. Jackson, Cobie Smulders and Stellan Skarsgard. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Seamus McGarvey.

Asgardian outcast Loki (Hiddlestone) has struck a deal with the Chitauri to exchange the Tesseract for an army with which he can attack Earth and thus control it. With the Earth in mortal danger, S.H.I.E.L.D director Nick Fury (Jackson) activates the Avengers Initiative; a collection of super heroes and deadly assassins who, if they can actually come together as one united force, hold the fate of the Earth in their hands.

I have no real frame of reference with The Avengers comic book world, when I was young I read a bit of Spidey, Batman and was kind of partial to The Fantastic Four, but I really don't remember story lines and gave up reading that sort of stuff once sport and exams came into my life. I love movies and as I enter the later stages of my forties I'm pleased to say I have a wide range of film genre interests. I have very much enjoyed The Avengers solo films so far, with the exception of Iron Man 2 which quite frankly is average at best, but the reality is that if The Avengers failed as a movie, that Whedon got it so wrong, then I wouldn't be foaming at the mouth or proclaiming that the director be stripped naked and whipped around the streets of Hollywood! As it is, with one or two minor irks aside, The Avengers is about as much fun as I have had with a movie in quite a few years.

I wouldn't know if the makers got the essence right, or if the story is at one in the Marvel Avengers Universe, I just know that it is a right old blast and made a colossal amount of money at the box office, even trumping The Dark Knight Rises in that department. It's a film full of derring-do heroics, ripe witticisms, wonderfully staged action, simmering sexual tensions, ego collisions, charm, heart and splendid human interactions. It looks fabulous on Blu-ray, the art design, the colour photography and Silvestri's score rumbles like thunder and crackles like lightning, just as a super hero movie score should do. The cast performances are hugely enjoyable as they bounce off of one and other, feeding off the respective thespian energy with a knowing of the right tone to make this colourful comic book world be all that it can be. While Whedon, with a weight of expectation akin to Atlas holding the World on his shoulders, comes through with flying colours with astute pacing and an impressive marshaling of an acting army.

Flaws? Jackson's Nick Fury could have done with more screen time and Cobie Smulders is sadly short changed as well. The Chitauri are only really a threat because of their sheer numbers, not because of any great alien design, and, well, The Hulk CGI hasn't really advanced much from the 2008 version, but really these are small itches rather than big ones. Is The Avengers the best film of 2012? It will be seen as such for many fans of the source(s) who have waited with baited breath for this coming together of their heroes, and that notion really shouldn't irk the more highbrow film fans out there. Me? No it isn't the best film of 2012, but as I found my self perched on the edge of my seat as the finale unfurls in a wave of explosive heroic energy, and I caressed my ribs from laughing out loud, I knew then that undoubtedly The Avengers is the most fun film of 2012. 9/10"
Justin Lopez,"The Avengers is a dream movie come true for superhero fans with its group of extremely talented actors and epic champions, to create an action- packed movie with hilarious banter laced in between scenes. I love how each of the actors and actresses has portrayed each of the roles they were given."
LoganWright,"Definitely the greatest superhero movie of all time. Marvel has set the bar high with this one and so far, they're doing a good job of keeping up with that despite not being able to raise it higher!"
BradleyStewart,I found it creative of Marvel to introduce each character one by one. It really set the tone and had me looking forward to what's gonna happen.
Jane Hall,Perfect casting! You can really see and feel that the actors have great chemistry both in and out of their characters.
JessieCollins,Wonderful movie to watch if you want to be entertained and not think about the plot too much.
John Smith,"When you have a bunch of flashy superheroes fighting supernatural, extraterrestrial villains from another dimension, it can get pretty hard to highlight each of their strengths,  but Marvel pulled it off with this one!"
Justin Lopez,"The Avengers is a dream movie come true for superhero fans with its group of extremely talented actors and epic champions, to create an action- packed movie with hilarious banter laced in between scenes.

1RobertJohnson1,I tried my best to avoid getting carried away by the hype of this movie because nowadays most of the movies that are too much hyped end up just being disappointments but I'm glad to say that I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED when this came out.
MichaelWilliams,One word for this movie: AWESOME. It’s an amazing film and has everything a superhero fanboy hoped for and more.
WilliamJones,One of the many things I loved in this film was the conflict between Iron Man and Captain America for leadership and how the two differ in their approach. A very unique way of building a team of superheroes.
DavidBrown1,The cast really delivered. Sure they were playing the roles of superheroes but you can really see and feel a deeper level of emotions in their performance.
JosephWilson,Kudos to the fight choreographers who designed all the action sequences for this movie. They really did a good one!
richardmiller,"If you haven't seen this film yet, do yourself a favor and remain unspoiled. This is one of the movies that need to be savored."
ThomasMoore,Good fighting sequences but camerawork feels too crazy and made it quite difficult to fully enjoy the great choreography.
Andres Gomez,More of the same ... but it is not funny any more ...
waqas akram,This is just **awesome**
John Chard,"View it as a spin off and it's a rollicking treasure seeking adventure.

Ok lets have it out front right away, this particular writer loved the first film (Curse of the Black Pearl), was disappointed with the second (Dead Man's Chest) and positively found the third (At World's End) to be an incomprehensible bore. Part 4: On Stranger Tides is a shift in another direction, where a group of piratical characters, some we know well, others new to the fold, embark on missions to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. So think ""Indiana Jones"", ""National Treasures"" like adventures (hell even ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"") and you get the drift here. Expectation of this franchise getting back to the heady days of that first film will be crushed pretty early on.

There's a little too much going on here for it to be safe children's fare, but the adults, especially those who remember the serial silliness of adventure films of yore, will have a good time. The action set-pieces are superb, enter high speed carriage chase through London, some spiffing sword play deep in the brewery, Blackbeard (Ian McShane) using his black magic whiles to incarcerate mutineers in a whirl of maniacal ropes, and a mermaid attack that quite frankly rocks - as do the mermaids themselves the sexy vicious teasers they are.

Production is as expected top notch, and the cast, in spite of having to battle for screen time in a cast of thousands, are doing fine work (Penélope Cruz a welcome heaving bosom of spunkiness). For sure our main man Captain Jack Sparrow, with Depp just about keeping the characters charm on tap, isn't as dominating a force as we would like, but he leaves his trusty fun mark and the others (Barbosa is back drinking rum out of his newly acquired peg leg) pick up the slack. It's unlikely to get better on revisits, so if you be hardcore POTC from earlier adventures, there's no point going back to se tis one. Those who like the type of films mentioned previously, and don't mind a different direction for the series, then tis holds no fears. 7/10"
Gimly,"Personal low point in the series to me. Brolin does do a commendable job of playing a young Tommy Lee Jones, but the script doesn't deliver. Not only is it not a very good one, it just offers the same story. **Again**. This is three Men in Black movies in a row where the A-plot is totally encapsulated by one sentence: ""Stop the creepy-crawly in a human suit from getting the jewelery."" There's a supporting role alien that was pretty endearing though.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
Filipe Manuel Dias Neto,"**This film knew how to honor and equal the first film.**

Despite their popularity, the first two MIB films, from the turn of the century, are films I don't really like to watch. The first movie, from 1997, is still worth it, but the second one was so bad that they had to wait more than ten years for this movie to come out, and even then, we still remember it. Good news: this movie is virtually as good as the first one and knows how to meet the public's expectations.

The plot is reasonably simple, but it guarantees entertainment: over the years, the boss of the MIB organization became a woman. Meanwhile, the escape of a dangerous alien from the lunar prison will force J to travel back in time, to the beginning of K's career, to try to prevent planet Earth from being invaded by a destructive galactic force. The script does a reasonably effective job and there is a lot of movement and action.

Will Smith shows that he has matured as an actor, and he knew how to imprint that maturity on the MIB agent he played: J is no longer a rookie or someone who accepts lessons, he is a senior agent with experience, who knows what he is doing and is sufficiently trained to deal with what you have in hand. Of course, K remains a veteran, and Tommy Lee Jones won't let that go by the wayside: sullen and seemingly unflappable, Jones' character will take particular pleasure in lecturing and lecturing Smith whenever appropriate. And, ultimately, it's the way the two actors interact that makes the movie funnier. The villain is worthy of our dislike and has some good jokes and tongue-in-cheek lines, but Jemaine Clement seems to have sometimes exaggerated things a bit. Michael Stuhlbarg and Josh Brolin do a very honest and committed job, and they help substantially to increase the quality of the film.

Technically, there is a serious and substantial bet on CGI, computerization and computer-made effects. It's something almost predictable, nowadays it's a very widespread resource and sci-fi or action movies have learned to master it. However, the authenticity of real scenes always tastes good. So the ending seems to be a bit out of step with the rest of the movie, but that turns out to be a minor problem. The cinematography is quite well executed, the sound and soundtrack are effective, the visuals as well. The sets and wardrobe, as well as the props, are in line with what you would expect to find in a MIB film."
Andres Gomez,"As there was not much more to be told from the end of the previous movie, just assist to more than 2h of continuous battle.

Quite pointless, but you may enjoy the action if that is what you were looking for ..."
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"The Lord of The Rings are still occupying the three top places of my top ten movies list. Needless to say I am a fan of Tolkien and his Middle Earth fantasy story. I never felt that The Hobbit series could match the original trilogy but then much of the story in The Hobbit is not really Tolkien’s but produced by Hollywood scriptwriters to embellish the story enough to fill three movies. It is not a bad attempt by any means (for being a Hollywood one) but it does not really reach the heights of The Lord of The Rings.

Still, I quite liked these movies. They are good adventure, fantasy, special effects movies. Thus it saddened me when I went to IMDb and the first things I saw was a bunch of people shouting crap and giving it one star reviews. That is just so much rubbish. This is the third movie and it is not vastly different from the others. If you disliked the first ones so much why go and see this one? Also, the harping about not following the book. At this point that is a nonsense argument. It was fairly obvious that it was not going to follow the book in detail when it was announced that there were going to be three movies and if you did not get it then then you should have gotten it from the other two movies. One star ratings looks more like trolling to me.

Anyway, back to the movie itself. I definitely liked this movie better than the second one. It was on par with the first one for me. There was less silly stuff, less stuff that just felt like fillers and the special effects were generally good.

The story and the implementation is, as I wrote, less filled with fillers as the last movie. At least from my point of view. Still though, the story is not at all up to the standard of the original Tolkien works. It shows that it is a Hollywood product that favors effects and quantity before depth and quality. The battle at the end was epic but at the same time somewhat nonsensical in how people ran back and forth clobbering people and beasts right left and center. I did quite like the ramming troll though.

I have to say that I did not like that weasel Alfrid. Sure he was meant to be disliked but he got tiresome rather quickly. He could have been left out after being pushed into the water as far as I am concerned. After that I just got annoyed every time he appeared and I got especially annoyed by the fact that everyone, even Gandalf, seemed to trust him to actually do what he was told. I was hoping all the way to the finishing scenes that he would meet a gruesome end.

On the whole I definitely liked this movie. It had a “Tolkienesque” athmosphere, decent acting, decent story and loads and loads of special effects. Even though it does not reach the heights of The Lord of The Rings it is definitely great entertainment for the fantasy, not to mention special effects, lovers."
Gimly,"Comparing the _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy and the _Hobbit_ trilogy was already like comparing apples and mediocre oranges, but none so mediocre as _Battle of the Five Armies_. Don't get me wrong, I love a ""battle"" as much as the next guy, more maybe, I don't even mind a movie that's 95% battle, but in this? It does. Not. Work.

_Five Armies_ is a movie that never made it out of pre-viz, let alone to a polished, well-rounded, final cut. I enjoy it to some degree when running through a Middle-Earth marathon as a whole, but only when the group I'm with will let me roll my eyes and complain about it.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
r96sk,"Exactly what it says on the tin - to a fault.

Don't get me wrong, I like it. However, towards the end <em>'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies'</em> definitely begins to drag quite heavily - the impact of what eventually happens did not, to be honest, hit as strongly as it could've/should've. The pure action is good, but there's not much to remember about everything else.

None of the characters, with the exception of Richard Armitage (Thorin) and Luke Evans (Bard) I guess, stand out amidst the wall-to-wall battle. Martin Freeman (Bilb), Ian McKellen (Gandalf) & Co. are are of little importance really, which is a shame.

<em>'The Hobbit'</em> series, unfortunately, gets inferior as it goes by. Loved the first film, enjoyed the second but this third installment - while passable - leaves me with a feeling of wanting something else from it. Happy to have watched them though, I'd still recommend them for sure."
tmdb23365124,"“The Amazing Spider-Man” has no reason to exist. Spider-man is a hero everyone knows. He´s been around for so long everyone is familiar with his origin, comic fan or not. Its basic pop culture. Then you have the Sam Raimi´s movies. Everyone saw them. They made loads of money and they´re always on tv. They are entertaining movies. “Spider-Man” gave us a good origin story in 2002. This movie simply wasn't needed. 
Now I gave it the benefit of the doubt. There´s Burton´s Batman and Nolan´s. Maybe this was a different Spider-Man. A more “dark” vision perhaps! Maybe the movie spent a few minutes on the origin and then wisely moved on with its story. Maybe... well maybe it wasn't just another rehash. A shameless attempt to remake, or how they say it these days, reboot the same idea with minimal changes except the cast. I was naive.
The whole movie is about Spider-Man´s origin. They traded Mary Jane for another love interest and held off on “The Green Goblin” because that would be too much “rubbing it in the face” for the fans, I guess. We get Gwen Stacy and “The Lizard”. The rest is same old, same old. The same uncle Ben plot, the same scenes about making the suit, learning how to control powers, the search for the criminal Spider-man lets get away with horrific results. Same thing. Except everything is done without a spark of energy or creativity. Raimi´s movies were energetic, flowing with excitement. They were “new”. Seeing Spider-Man on the big screen,  webbing all over the city, fighting “The Green Goblin”, it was amazing. We didn't have “The Avengers” back there, or “Iron Man”. This was like a dream come true for comic fans. 
“The Amazing Spider-Man” smells of old cheese. 
I tried to take the movie for what it was but it was impossible. My mind would not let me. I knew what was going to happen next. I knew all the plots! I´d seen it all before! 
But even ignoring that the movie just does not work. Its slow, turgid with an unlikable Peter Parker and a CGI lizard for a villain. Parker is a whiny, self centered idiot. His relationship with aunt May and uncle Ben is never fully explored and what little there is consists of Parker being a rude jerk for no reason at all. 
The movie has one thing going for it. The cast. Sally Field and Martin Sheen are great with what little material they have. Emma Stone is sexy and sweet which is “her thing” and again she pulls it off brilliantly.  Rhys Ifans is decent as Curt Connors and surprisingly enough I loved Andrew Garfield as Spidey. Yes, seriously! He looks perfect for the part and he did his best with the horrible script. He´s charismatic and brought his own touch to the role instead of copying Toby Maguire. If the movie is even slightly original its because of him. 
Some of the action in the last third of the movie is also spectacular. Spider-man´s movements when fighting are really well done as is the web-slinging. The action is well directed and exciting and the movie sets up a sequel rather nicely. 
But its asking a lot to go over the material everyone knows for two hours for a few minutes of cool action. The movie plays it so safe it hurts. Its competent but never brilliant. Tedious but far too long with little spots of action but few and far between. 
I hope in the sequel this “Spider-Man” can find its own style and its own place. Given space to grow and evolve, on the strength of the character and Garfield´s acting this could be the weak start to a new amazing super-hero trilogy. 
Then again, maybe i´m just naive."
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"This is the fourth spider man movie although it is not the fourth sequel but rather one of these reboots which seems to be so popular today. I found the movie to be quite enjoyable but at the same time a bit of a let-down.

In some ways it is better than the previous trilogy by Sam Raimi (well it is not very hard to make something that is better than the 2nd installment in that trilogy of course). The film is darker, more serious and Spider Man is not so silly and a total mess-up when out of his costume as the character portrayed by Toby Maquire.

However, this movie has its own faults which makes me have to think hard whether it is really that much of an improvement over the previous movie and this is what makes me feel a bit let-down since I had hope that this reboot would be that “real” Spider Man movie that enabled me to forget about the previous ones.

A lot of not so interesting scenes are really dragged out and the important stuff is rushed. Peter Parker’s transition to Spider Man after his bitten is over and done with quite quickly. In another scene he spends 5 minutes trying to talk some kid out of a car. He even takes off his mask and gives it to him (what the f…) and in the end just zips him out with a net shot. He could have done that right away and spared us the boring time.

Generally I think this movie is indeed a better Spider Man movie than the previous ones though and I quite enjoyed the movie evening yesterday, just not as much as I hoped."
John Chard,"Webb's Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does what ever a Spider can.

The Amazing Spider-Man is directed by Marc Webb and collectively written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves. It stars Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, Martin Sheen and Sally Field. Music is by James Horner and cinematography by John Schwartzman. 

Peter Parker (Garfield) was orphaned as a boy when his parents were killed in a plane crash, raised by his Uncle Ben (Sheen) and Aunt May (Field), he is a clever lad but something of an outcast at high school. While investigating the disappearance of his parents and sporting a crush on class mate Gwen Stacy (Stone), Peter's life is tipped upside down when he is bitten by a radioactive spider that gives him abnormal powers. 

While the Spider-Man franchise doesn't (thankfully) come packaged with the kind of bizarre mania that comes with Batman, the acolytes are a tough bunch to figure out. Sam Raimi's trilogy garnered close towards $2.5 billion worldwide, yet now, with this reboot (actually it's a reimaging) trundled off of the Sony production line, there are plenty of ""fans"" coming forward to say they never rated Raimi's films! Magurie was this, Dunst was that, Raimi missed the beat of the comic version of Spidey and etc and etc. Well I'm sorry, but I just don't remember any fall out apart from the near unanimously agreed upon over stuffing of Raimi's part 3. Perhaps I just didn't go on the right Spider-Man forums? But even then it's hard to argue with a box office take of $2.5 billion, those figures have to be made up of a good proportion of Spidey fans, surely? You would reasonably think. 

I mention it because The Amazing Spider-Man has met with reviews from each end of the scale. Those at the high end who support the ""reimaging"" seem to focus on it being close to the real Spidey universe they wanted, with great casting, better effects work and a origin story of worth. At the other end is the arguments that ""reimaging"" a film that is only ten years old is daft, especially since it actually doesn't bring the promised new direction or origin story of worth. In fact it just juggles bits of the Raimi trilogy and plays it out with other Spider-Man characters instead. While Garfield is hardly an improvement since he's way too old for high school as well! The truth is that Webb's movie falls somewhere in between both sides of the argument, and that's not just me being Switzerland and staying neutral! 

Negatively it plays out as a compromised production and not the film that the makers initially set out to make, there are too many dangling threads and haphazard edits that leave narrative gaps. An Important character disappears off the radar, other characters are given limited time to breathe, and crucial plot points are arrived at with stupendous leaps of logic. A coda spliced into the end credits tries to entice us for the sequel, suggesting that the quick wipe over the origin ""origin"" story was deliberate, it's unlikely, and feels like an afterthought. For a film that purports to be putting its own stamp on the Spidey universe, it quite often makes you think of Raimi's films anyway. It may be The Lizard instead of Green Goblin and Gwen instead of MJ, but the emotional and psychological beats are still the same. Reboot? My arse. Oh and Horner, who I'm normally a fan of, has turned in a score that lacks vim and vigour, it aspires to be full of swirling superhero fervour to raise the goose flesh on your arms, but instead it's just goose, and not a decently cooked one at that. 

However, on the positive side of things, low expectation really helped me to enjoy the film, and I even watched it a second time to check over some initial reactions I had. There is still a lot to enjoy here. Acting is of a high standard (Ifans' performance as Curt Connors gets better on repeat viewings), with good chemistry generated between Stone and Garfield, the effects work is (obviously) better ten years on; something which gives us a better-more acrobatic-moving Spider-Man, while the whole make-up of Parker as a geek who becomes cocky, even arrogant, really adds a kick to the first half of the movie's coming-of-age narrative bent. It's also good that with a running time of over two hours the makers have the time to expand Peter as a character, making the audience wait with expectation of his life changing date with the spider. As for the villain, it's true enough to say that The Lizard is hardly an inspiring choice, but it does fit in with the whole origin story plan that Webb and his team want to tell. Though it should be noted that those seeking wall to wall fights between Spidey and The Liz are going to go a little hungry. 

It's big on human story and not the lazy cash in movie it could have been, and undeniably it's fun, but the holes, dangling threads and logic leaps stop it breaking out to achieve its intentions. Looking forward to the sequel, mind 7/10"
CinemaSerf,"I enjoyed this. One of the great advantages of the whole ""Spiderman"" concept is that it can be reinvented time and time again without really compromising the original character - a decent but lonely young man trying to make his way in the world and to get his girl. Like Tobey Maguire before him, the casting of the largely unknown Andrew Garfield works well - it allows a whole new generation of fans to follow their hero. The fact that he is cute in tights doesn't do him any harm either. Emma Stone is quite good, too, as the object of his affections ""Mary Jane"" and the whole look of the film is sophisticated and colourful. The story is very derivative, however - and that is the problem with this film. Though there is plenty of action, it becomes a little repetitive and uninspired. The CGI will always look good, and will increasingly do most of the work with these kind of films - indeed, just about everything in the Marvel Universe is 90% style over substance; but so long as they can still recruit enthusiastic actors to play the roles than the franchise might still have legs (though hopefully not eight) for the future. Martin Sheen and Sally Field add a little gravitas to the proceedings - the former has one of these wonderful Churchillian style voices that just goes on resonating, and Rhys Ifans makes for an OK mad scientist. As a stand alone adventure this works fine. Maybe a bit too long, but a cinema experience to be relished - then, maybe, just put away again for seven years."
ohlalipop,"It wasn't really what I expected. I thought I'd be bored in my ass. I wasn't really. Ok. Maybe just a little. I didn't want to watch this because, come on, we all know Robin Hood's story. But then while watching it, I tell myself, this isn't the Robin Hood that I know. It's a different take on Robin Hood. Although I can't help but tell mayi that the movie could've been a lot better if Gerard Butler played Robin. But Russell Crowe delivered too. I'm just not a super big fan of his. And then Cate Blanchett, was intimidating as always. I mean not in a bad way. I think she's the celebrity that I'm most intimidated with. Her characters were always great. The movie was nice. Although I wouldn't rate it as super nice. It had its boring parts wherein I just want to close my eyes for a little. And then it felt like it was too long for me. I wasn't really into it that much although I was entertained."
Andres Gomez,"The second part amends the fiasco of the first one.

Spectacular and, again, with several moments of the already classic ""platform-like"" fights on the run from these series of movies that could be enhanced if some sense would be given to them. Still, the staging of every location and, remarkably, Smaug, is worth seeing."
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"7 out of 10 stars would normally be considered quite okay and I guess you could say that this movie is quite okay. However, it has a reputation to live up to. As a movie in the Tolkien universe and with LOTR and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey this movie have a lot to live up to and, as far as I am concerned, it does not.

As an action/adventure/fantasy movie it is a quite okay movie. It has a lot of action of course, a lot of adventure and a lot of special effects. Of course everything plays out with the Tolkien universe as a back-drop. I guess it is rather superfluous to mention that the movie is based on the book The Hobbit by Tolkien. However it is here the problems start.

In my review of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey the first thing that I mentioned was that you should be aware of the fact that the movie did not follow the book in any great detail and that this was quite okay since the extensions were well made. Well, it should be no surprise that the first part of this statement is valid for this movie as well. Unfortunately, whereas the first movie felt like a fluid extension of the book this one feels like it is just full of fillers.

There are a lot of cool scenes and a lot of action but it really feels like it was just put in there as fillers to showcase the special effects. Speaking of special effects, quite a few of them where rather unimpressive I have to say. The scenes where the dwarfs went down the rapids in barrels frequently looked plastic and artificial. The scenes with Smaug was not too bad even though he was quite overused but the parts around the forges was just plain ridiculous. I know it is fantasy but come one, getting them started and producing tons and tons of molten gold in a few minutes not to mention riding on molten metal without getting burned was just silly.

On the whole I found it an enjoyable movie but I was expecting more."
Tom Goetz,"Jackson turned a great story into just another Prates of the Caribbean. Jumping, sliding, gags, etc. All the thinking parts are gone."
Gimly,"I'm happy to be back in this world, but _Empire_ this ain't.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
r96sk,"Still very good, but I found <em>'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug'</em> to be a step below the preceding 2012 release.

The conclusion is what affects it the most, in my opinion. It isn't anything bad, but it goes on for too long - yet the ending itself comes out of nowhere a little. It's iffily crafted, with the entertainment value not enough to cover it up. Again, nothing anywhere near terrible... just not as great as I wanted/expected.

I also kinda wanted more scenes with Martin Freeman (Bilbo) across the midway point. I like the focus on Richard Armitage (Thorin) & Co. but I felt there needed to be more with the lead - and with Ian McKellen (Gandalf), for that matter.

I've led with my negatives first, but I have many positives too. I enjoyed the scenes in Esgaroth with Luke Evans (Bard), all of the stuff there looks awesome. The character of Tauriel, played by Evangeline Lilly, is cool. Orlando Bloom (Legolas) remains fun to watch. Everything else, including the score, is very nicely done - as anticipated.

Love the end credits song (""I See Fire"") by Ed Sheeran, by the way. Not quite as grand and great as ""May It Be"" from LOTR, but it's pretty close!"
CinemaSerf,"Philip Pullman novels are always dark and intricate - and they don't necessarily make a great deal of sense in isolation - so adapting them for the screen was likely to be a tough ask. This story centres around the young ""Lyra"" (Dakota Blue Richards) who overhears some sinister plotting by the ""Magisterium"" that could put the lives of other children - and the demons with whom they are connected - in dire jeopardy. Determined to thwart this, she heads to the frozen Arctic where she encounters ""Scoresby"" (Sam Elliott) and helps the dispossessed king of the polar bears ""Iorek Byrnison"" to reclaim his kingdom before all descend on an heavily guarded secret location where she hopes to free the children from the experiments. Director Chris Weisz has assembled a strong cast, on paper, here - but they don't really add much to what is an increasingly sterile story full of imaginative and impressive visual effects, but is remarkably devoid of engaging characterisations. Richards is fine, indeed given that she probably spent much of her time acting against a blue screen, she fairs quite well but Daniel Craig isn't on screen often/long enough to make much impact, nor is the conniving ""Mrs. Coulter"" (Nicole Kidman) used to anything like enough of an extent to exude much menace. Her adventures are well put together but are too episodic to knit the whole story together very well before a denouement that clearly illustrated that this story is part of a series and that more was yet to come in a sequel - if we were to make enough sense of the continuing dynamic. It's also rather wordy, too, which paired with the manner in which Weitz has decided to present this leaves it all just a bit dry, dull even. Great looking, though...!"
John Chard,"They just couldn't leave him on his island could they...

King Kong is directed by Peter Jackson and Jackson co-writes the screenplay with Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens. It's based on a story by Merian C. Cooper and Edgar Wallace. It stars Naomi Watts, Jack Black, Adrien Brody, Thomas Kretschmann, Colin Hanks, Andy Serkis, Evan Parke, Jamie Bell and Kyle Chandler. Music is by James Newton Howard and cinematography by Andrew Lesnie.

After completing the hugely successful Lord of the Rings trilogy, Peter Jackson turned his attentions to a reimaging of that daddy of classic creature features, King Kong. With all the new tools of the trade to hand, Jackson set about making a Kong film full of love and respect the original from 1933, whilst obviously making his own beast as it were. Story remains the same, mankind sets off to a fabled place known as Skull Island, there they find beasties not of this world, not least a gigantic mountain of a gorilla. They stupidly bring him back to America for money making exercises and things go really bad. The End.

I have personally found it most interesting re-watching the film nearly 15 years since its release, especially given we have not long had a different Kong reboot with ""Kong: Skull Island"" in 2017. For the differences, for better or worse depending on your proclivities in Kongdom, are enormous. Kong: Skull Island is a no brain adventure yarn, high on action but low on intelligence, but it does know it. Jackson's Kong aspired to be much more cerebral, and for the most part it achieves it. Sadly it takes a whopping 3 hours to reveal its intentions, which was a problem to many back in 2005, and is still a hindrance sitting down to watch it these days - this even knowing and preparing once again for how long it is. Frustratingly there's a great film in the mix just crying out for an hour of extraneous filler and clunky dialogue to be jettisoned. 

Once set up has been achieved in the first hour, we finally get to Skull Island and it's an absolute technical treat. The look is fantastic, the turn of events as Kong and his acolytes have been introduced is terrific. From here it's creature feature mayhem, the beauty and the beast aspect kicks into gear, and it's all very comforting, thrilling even - with one exception. A dinosaur stampede looks ridiculous, the blend of human actors and CGI is so poor it belies the money spent on the effects for this production. That aside, though, the action sequences are electric, particularly the monster mash ups. Yet the quite reflective periods on Skull Island really strike a chord as well, just sections where Kong and Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) are chilling out together, taking in the landscape that money mad men want to take Kong away from...

Then it's back to The States and carnage ensues, culminating in a brilliantly staged last quarter of film, where all that superb period detail gets obliterated during the battle between man and beast, and where even now I'm rooting for Kong to win! As the tenderness of the Beauty and the Beast arc subsides - and it is beautiful - it's then that you once again know that Jackson was too indulgent. His cast were on form, Serkis as Kong a revelation, this is a great picture at times, a real treat in High Definition, if only someone had fronted him up to not over indulge. For then we might have a 9/10 movie as opposed to a bloated 7/10 one."
John Chard,"Beautiful Romance - Tragedy Unbound.

It has kind of become the popular thing to kick Titanic, the film and its achievements. It's like the love it garnered on release and the colossal waves it made in the history of cinema, never happened, or as some want you to believe, doesn't matter. I can tell you now that many of my macho fuelled friends will privately, under the influence of liquid refreshments, admit to having affection for the film, but socially in a circle environment? Not a bit of it! I have no such problems admitting my love for the film, I love it as much now as I approach 50, as I did when I sat there in awe at the cinema in 1997.

You jump - I jump.

Titanic is far from flawless, where even now with the advancements in technology the effects over 15 years later look a touch creaky. While it's true as well that away from Rose and Jack the characterisations are thin on the ground. But this is Rose and Jack's story, fully fleshed out for an hour and half and then framed by the terrible tragedy that unfolds for the next hour and half. The tie-in to the present day is superbly constructed by James Cameron - the search for the diamond - the real life filming of the Titanic wreckage - and the flashback telling of the story by a delightful Gloria Stuart as old Rose, and the sinking of the ship and its aftermath is stunning and heart breaking in equal measure.

Never let go.

So may scenes and dialogue exchanges stay in the memory for ever. The band playing on, the captain awaiting his fate, the mother ushering her children to sleep before the sea comes to take them, the old boy drinking his brandy as the water rushes in, or just Jack and Rose, polar opposites in society's class structure, making love, making art or just professing that neither will ever let go. It's what makes Titanic the wonderful piece of cinema it is, where beauty and tragedy merge to create something forever memorable. A film that deserved all the accolades and cash till ringing that it once did have. 9/10"
CinemaSerf,"Set around the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS ""Titanic"", this is essentially a film in two parts. The first, weaker, element features a young ""Dawson"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who wins a third class ticket to New York on the soon to depart liner. Meantime, the wealthy but unhappy ""Rose"" (Kate Winslet) is up in the posh cabins with her cold and unfeeling fiancée ""Hockley"" (Billy Zane) and her equally unpleasant, venally ambitious mother ""Ruth"" (Frances Fisher). Desperately unhappy, ""Rose"" considers jumping off the prow of the boat, but luckily the charming young ""Dawson"" is on hand to talk her down, and so begins their friendship that causes much chagrin amongst her socially elite companions. That friendship culminates in him making a rather provocative drawing of her, the final straw for her boyfriend and his enforcer ""Lovejoy"" (David Warner). It all looks ominous for both until - part two begins. The ship, speeding along nicely under the command of Bernard Hill's Captain Smith clips the underwater part of an iceberg and now history takes over. James Cameron offers us a purely speculative account of what might have happened as the initially incredulous crew start to realise that maybe it is not just Molly Brown (an excellent Kathy Bates) that's unsinkable! What now ensues are a series of well staged scenarios depicting panic, fear, a fair degree of selfishness and some proper stiff upper lips as the ship has be evacuated and the segregation of the passengers and competencies of the crew start to become life threatening. The visual effects have dated, the smoke from the ship's funnels blows in an strangely symmetrical fashion and the later scenes struggle to convince - but this is really a rather tragic love story with a strong chemistry between the engaging two characters at the top of the bill, and an effective performance from the older ""Rose"" (Gloria Stewart) who takes on the role of narrator 80 years after the disaster. I still find it uncomfortable to watch the actuality of the wreck, which features occasionally throughout the film - I feel like I am quite literally walking through someone's grave; but it does lend a potent hook upon which this lengthy, but well thought out and constructed drama is presented. Criticisms have been made of it's factual inaccuracies, and it may well play a bit fast and loose with some of the real characterisations - but it's a drama, and to be enjoyed has to be appreciated in that sphere. Big screen is a must, it really does lose a great deal on a television."
Frank Ochieng,"Well another super-sized Marvel Comics superhero saga hits the big screen with the selected savior Captain America taking the top billing on the marquee. Thus, the pulsating popcorn pleaser **Captain America: Civil War** arrives on the scene to giddy audiences that have been loyal and fixated on the successful spring of mighty Marvel heroes that have been paraded to viewers throughout the last few years. Thankfully, **Captain America: Civil War** carries on the tradition of spry superhero-studded spectacles that have been glorious and adventurous from the stable of Marvel-based movies guaranteed to win over the enthusiastic hearts of avid comic book fanboys everywhere. Joyously overstuffed and convincingly extensive with a super team armed with crime-fighting excess, **Civil War** seizes the moment to introduce a noteworthy twist: two factions of rescuing superpowers engaging in some explosive in-house fighting led by two of Marvel Comics main standouts in Chris Evans’s Captain America and Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man.

Co-directors Anthony Russo and Rene Russo were instinctively crafty to link the overly successful Iron Man film franchise to the **Captain America: Civil War** inner circle to ensure an even more treasured toxic atmosphere. Superhero fans will get a thrill of witnessing the extra add-ons concerning other dynamic titans to join the action-packed festivities involving Team Captain America versus Team Iron Man. True, **Civil War** has its share of flaws but that does not take away from this heroes-in-crisis flick demonstrating its ambitious overtones.

So what has caused the bad blood among the great and grand good guys known for protecting the world from evil dominance and destruction? Essentially the theme of collateral damage, the involvement regarding civilian-related deaths and injuries plus the world-wide backlash has created a controversy pitted against The Avengers. Specifically, Captain America (a.k.a. Steve Rogers) and Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen)  are responsible for the boisterous battle that caused such negative sensation resulting in political turmoil. Avengers head honcho Iron Man (a.k.a. Tony Stark) is dealing with his own personal regrets in the ill-advised creation of the unpredictable Ultron. The political authority want to hold Iron Man, second-in-command Captain America and the rest of the Avengers accountable for the global devastation that have taking its toll when trying to oversee the potential harm wreaking havoc on humanity.

Leading the charge in putting a watchful eye on the labeled reckless Avengers is Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) that suggests the super group be monitored by the United Nations. Naturally friction develops between the superheroes that either agree with Ross’s UN restriction policies or disagree with being placed under a microscope that threatens to handcuff their free-wheeling heroic duties. All these contrasting beliefs eventually turn into epic back-and-forth confrontations where the raging Avengers are at odds with each other.

For Stark/Iron Man’s stance, he is willing to toe the line and ultimately agree that his crew needs to tone down their tenacious tactics as crime-stoppers. Iron Man’s consciousness, particularly in the case of a disillusioned mother (Alfre Woodward) making him feel guilt-ridden over her son’s death during an intense Battle of Sokovia, is probably the main factor behind his decision to have his team reigned in a bit from the political watchdogs. Siding with Iron Man’s viewpoint are the likes of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision (Paul Bettany) and War Machine (Don Cheadle). As for Rogers/Captain America, he is not too thrilled being put in check by the intrusive governmental pencil-pushers that want to scrutinize the team’s every move. Standing with Captain America firmly are Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and the aforementioned Scarlet Witch.

On top of Captain America’s current Avengers-oriented strife in his contentious mingling with Iron Man and his ardent backers, he now finds himself trying to defend his old buddy-turned-wanted man Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) who is accused of killing civilians. Iron Man believes in Winter Soldier’s innocence and goes so far as to help him escape. Yes…Winter Soldier does come with more baggage attached to him–mainly in the form of the menacing Zemo (Daniel Bruhl).

The Russos and screenwriters Christopher Marckus and Stephen McFeely (all attached to the previous “Captain America: Winter Soldier”) provide the eyeful visual effects that predictably stimulate and effectively add to the overload of frenzied frolicking in this boisterous blockbuster. Certainly the deepened angst among this bombastic bunch works far more solidly than what was displayed in the stiffened and problematic Batman v. Superman. The notion that the entire globe and its leaders are weary of all the collective chaos at the hands of the Avengers trying to save their hides is a bit ridiculous. Besides, why are not the foes of the Avengers put on the hot coals for the societal ruination? It seems rather counterproductive to chastise the noble superpowers offering the safety of mankind yet the detractors not being grateful for the services that the Avengers bring to the table. It is somewhat convoluted to think that the global community are sour on our heralded heroes or that the heat generated within the walls will completely destroy the Avengers and their colorful, capable colleagues.

The movie’s aptly entitled **Civil War** does invite more punch to the proceedings especially when a who’s who of superhero showstoppers join the feisty fray at hand. The noted inclusion of defiant do-gooders are packed with the likes of Spider-Man (Tom Holland), the retired returnee Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and nifty newcomer Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). No doubt Captain America: Civil War is the impish and energizing launch pad for upcoming Marvel-induced movies waiting to make their future distinctive arrival on the big screen. Although Evans’s steady and charismatic Captain America more than holds his own as the solo act billed in the film’s title one cannot overlook Downey’s compelling Iron Man as the reliable source that lifts the profile of Evans’s Masked Wonder. This is indeed a collaborative big score for the glorified costumed cast but special kudos are reserved for Stan’s killing culprit as well as Boseman’s African president assuming the slick and resourceful Black Panther.

Yeah, **Captain America: Civil War** is true to its frenetic form as revved up entertainment preparing moviegoers for the upcoming summertime sizzle at the box office. After all, the on-screen Marvel Comics gravy train keeps moving merrily along so stay tuned.

Austin Singleton,"The Russo Brother's and Marvel did it again! Read my full review here!

Reno,"**The heroes're divided and so the fans!**

Before watching this I thought what the Avengers are doing here. I believed they got the title wrong. Once I watched it, I'm still the same. Because it did not look like the Captain America's film, he never was dominated, so calling it as his film totally inappropriate. Technically, it is a third Avengers film and well done. I liked it, it was entertaining. But the Civil War means it's nothing a nation's war within, just these super-guys fight for themselves against what kind of administration they want to come under.

I think they have heard that people's complaint about blowing up the buildings during reviewing other films by bringing up this one. So they finger pointed those events in this narration and that is one of the reasons for the Civil War to take place. Particularly disturbing the public and loss of many lives when these powerful men fighting the bad guys. The fun part is they are off the street and had a most important confrontation of the film in a deserted airfield. So does it make people who were whining about that be happy?

I don't know, but as an entertaining film, it did everything it can give the best for the viewers. Like the title and posters reveal, the heroes are divided here and probably you're going to take a side. Like usual, I'm with the Stark. So if you're like me, then you would feel the annoyance with the opposite team, particularly like Antman and obviously Captain America's rebellious decision. It was like the world versus United States, because only Americans are behind Captain America. Anyway, I did not like dividing the fans and what this film has been a serious damage. I hope the fans won't take it seriously.

_8/10_"
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"Recently I have quite liked the Marvel movies that I have watched. Sadly I did not like this movie at all. The only reason that it does not get a zero or one star rating is cool special effects and a few laughs.

I want my heroes to be just that, heroes. Unfortunately this movie gets off on the wrong foot right away by not only “incriminating” the Avengers in the eyes of dimwit politicians and putting them on surveillance of a political body but to make matters worse it is the useless black hole of taxpayers money, the United Nations, that are supposed to surveil them. That pretty much ruined the movie right away for me.

When I though that it could not get any worse it actually does. In true Hollywood fashion the Avengers start to bicker and fight among themselves.

The few redeeming qualities of this movie is great special effects and a few fun comments that made me laugh from time to time. Even the ending is pretty crappy with the Avengers remaining divided and the main bad guy feeling that he achieved what he wanted.

Technically there is not really anything wrong with the movie. The actors are good, the filming is good and, as I wrote, the special effects are great. The story however is not my cup of tea to put it mildly. I cannot express how much I despised the story in this movie."
ianlo930627,"Good movie, love Captain American."
Gimly,"<b>A long form review originally posted in 2016</b>

It’s commonplace for me to need more than one viewing to really nail down my feelings on a movie, that’s particularly true of MCU, and even more so of this particular film. That all said, here is my initial reaction to _Captain America: Civil War_.

As is often the case, it’s hard to write down too comprehensive a post about a film this early on while remaining totally spoiler-free, so for starters, I’ll just go ahead and ask the thing that was on my mind from about five minutes in to _Civil War_: I want to know how it is that two guys who have a filmography so firmly rooted in sitcoms of all things, manage to direct action this spectacularly? Honestly. It’s insane.

_Winter Soldier_ is one of the strongest MCU films in my opinion, and just like that felt mostly like a follow up to both the prior _Captain America_ film and the prior _Avengers_ film, _Civil War_ feels the same, but for the sequels to said films (_Winter Soldier_ and _Age of Ultron_). That said, it might lean a little too far on to the side of _Avengers_-sequel, and a little too light on the _Cap_-sequel. If you had to pick a lead here, it would be Steve Rogers, no mistake, but this does feel like a film painted with a very broad brush of characterisation to be solely a “_Captain America_” movie.

Considering the sheer scope of the piece, it’s amazing that the Russo brothers managed to get the ball rolling on _Civil War_ as well as they did. Even so, there are a couple of roles I felt could have been cut altogether without really impacting the story, and that time could perhaps have been used to serve some underrepresented puzzle pieces. Perhaps both the inclusion in places and lack of inclusion in others is because of plans for future MCU films (though certainly not all instances can use that excuse) but either way, if I’m hunting for flaws, that to some degree is one.

I will say, that for all of _Civil War’s_ ups and downs (mostly ups), it is both a worthy entrant into Marvel’s franchise, and perhaps even more importantly, it actually even addresses some of the problems left in _Age of Ultron_. Of course the acting is all above board, the primary action set-piece is just dumbfoundingly fun, and the evolution of the mythology meshes with the universe at large.

_Civil War_ may not be my favourite superhero movie, or even my favourite MCU movie (I mean it also might be, I think I need to give it at least another two watches to be sure) but it might just be the best comic book adaptation movie. By that, I don’t mean it accurately portrayed the events of the Marvel “Civil War” event from back 2006, because that’s not even close to true. What I mean is, there are so many instances that manage capture the spirit of what the comics are. And you almost feel like you are watching one unfold before you on the screen. A glorious, squillion dollar, two and a half hour comic book.

Oh yeah. And the new superheroes introduced in _Civil War_? They’ve got me pretty bloody excited.

tmdb44006625,"The Captain America movies have managed to ground the MCU by exploring the political and social climate created by the Avengers' existence. Actions have consequences and consequences influence more action.

Civil War isn't as focused as The Winter Soldier. It's also overstuffed with characters and fan service. However, the movie works by always being intriguing. Both sides of the conflict are portrayed as equally valid. The exploration of superhero accountability isn't anything new (explored in Watchmen and The Dark Knight), but it's nice to see it incorporated into a grand cinematic universe. Also, Captain Zemo is a better than average villain because while underdeveloped, his motive is interesting and not just ""destroy the world.""

Also, SPIDER-MAN IS FINALLY IN THE MCU!!!! 😁😁😁"
StevenGarcia,Captain America vs Iron Man. Setting 2 of Marvel's greatest heroes against each other was truly the fight of the century. Now that is an action-packed superhero movie!
AndrewMartinez,"I'm on Team Iron Man on this one. Capt America's reason for me was a bit childish at least. Impressive fights, and with this one, the superheroes were forced to make choices and choose which team would they fight for."
KennethRobinson,"A truly spectacular movie! 10/10 Story, paired with great acting from the cast, alongside the introduction of new superheroes, made the experience worthwhile. I am so excited about what the next phase of the upcoming MCU films has to offer."
GeorgeClark,"I was loving every second of it! Fascinating action scenes, and it all came down to the point where all the Marvels heroes must fight to prove a point. All I can say is that I enjoyed the movie, and will definitely watch it again."
KevinRodriguez1,"Marvel did it again! Captain America: Civil War is a thrilling, action-packed Marvel movie that will surely entertain you through and through. The MCU became more tense because of the plot of the movie, and loyalty and friendship were put into jeopardy, and this one fractured the team to 2 sides."
BrianLewis,"Kudos to the Russo brothers for making a great Marvel movie again. Amazing choreography, fight scenes, chase scenes, and great stunt work."
EdwardLee,"At the end of the day, Captain America: Civil War is a movie about friendship and vengeance, and how these two things split the Avengers into 2 groups, and forced all the superheroes to make a choice on whom to fight for."
RonaldWalker,"Both the mental and internal conflicts for this movie were so great! After the events of Age of Ultron, this pushed for the amendment of the law which was the catalyst for the splitting of the Avengers into two. Simply amazing!"
TimothyHall,"I might give this movie an A+ rating. It is a great film, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Thumbs up!"
JasonAllen1,"That's it? It is not terrible but I think it can go even further. Too confusing, not funny, Captain America's reason is childish, and I think it is just a showcase of special moves."
RyanHernandez,"FRIENDSHIP? OR THE WORLD? Capt. America proves that being a friend means that even if the entire world is against you, he will be there with you till the end."
GaryWright,"Civil War is just like the prequel for the Infinity War, where a lot of Marvel's heroes are showcased. More hyped to see what will happen after the Avengers were disbanded."
EricHill,"Spiderman and Black Panther's introduction to this movie made it a whole lot better. And we can expect that that is a foreshadow for their upcoming movies, too."
John Chard,"It rhymes with ship!

Actually that's a little unfair, for those after a two hour plus movie of noise and robotic like destruction, then this has a modicum of popcorn frivolity about it. But it's all so vacuous, any semblance of a story is given over for a chance to show some Transformers effects work, the human characters constantly an afterthought as they play second fiddle to another CGI action scene. It feels like an extended toy advertisement, the acting is sub-standard and the editing - appropriately enough for the film's setting - is akin to a bout of sea sickness. The action sequences all carry a familiarity about them, while like their human counterparts, the alien foe here are devoid of any rhyme or reason as to their motive and being.

Cash infused metallic porn at its most tiresome. 5/10"
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"I have to say that I enjoyed this movie. The visual effects are great, the alien designs are interesting and there’s lots of explosive hardware flying around. Although not exactly a very logical/practical design I did like the cool rolling “balls” of destruction that the aliens where using. Seeing the “Mighty Mo” in action was of course an additional plus. It’s really a shame that these magnificent floating fortresses have become obsolete.

However, the enjoyment brought by this movie was almost purely one of visual effects. Well, I generally like Liam Neeson as well but not much else in this movie was of any higher standards. The story is the usual Hollywood stuff. The holes in the logic are big enough to drive, well, a battleship through. For instance, the aliens can come from far away, navigate between the stars, but they cannot avoid accidentally colliding with a satellite in earth orbit? Come on.
 
It unfortunately becomes even worse when they decide to fire up the Missouri. I could live with the fact that there’s no way that a handful of veterans could have gotten that ship into running state. I could even live with the fact that the film ignores that it would take days to fire the ship up from cold storage even under optimal circumstances and with a full crew. But what really got me pissed off is when they drop the anchor to make a “hand break turn” and turn the ship around on a dime actually sliding the ship on the water. What the fuck !!!

How utterly ignorant, dumb, stupid can you become as a Hollywood producer/scriptwriter/director? I’m actually being kind to these morons now because if the people that wrote that scene is not total idiots then they are assuming that the audience are such idiots which would be even worse.

That part alone dropped it two stars for me. I still gave it 6 out of 10 because I enjoyed the visual effects and the sea battles so much."
jonlikesmoviesthatdontsuck,"I was a huge fan of the original 3 movies, they were out when I was younger, and I grew up loving dinosaurs because of them. This movie was awesome, and I think it can stand as a testimonial piece towards the capabilities that Christopher Pratt has. He nailed it. The graphics were awesome, the supporting cast did great and the t rex saved the child in me. 10\5 stars, four thumbs up, and I hope that star wars episode VII doesn't disappoint,"
Ganesan,Overall action packed movie... But there should be more puzzles in the climax... But I really love the movie.... Excellent...
redTed,"I've never been a fan of this series. The only impressive thing of the original was the graphics that were, at the time, breathtaking. But we all know great graphics alone can't save a film. 
I watched this new effort just to see how far CGI has come in the time since the original and I can safely say, not very far. From the opening scene with the terrible looking and poorly animated bird, it's obvious that CGI has reached its limits in recreating realistic content. 
As for the film. The dreadful script and annoying characters helped me lose any interest after about 15 mins. Ok for the age range it's aimed at I suppose, but there are far better films out there worthy of your money."
John Chard,"Untamable Devil.

One thing that would be 100% guaranteed prior to the release of Jurassic World, is that whatever the quality, or lack of, the notices would be mixed. Thus the reactions would be akin to those that ""Indiana Jones 4"" received, charges of ruining childhoods and franchises etc.

Jurassic World does exactly what is expected of it, it's a popcorn blockbuster that plays out as mindless fun, complete with outstanding effects, monster mayhem and moments of dumbness. In fact it's very much a safe sequel, reverting to the original formula without the classy edges of Spielberg's deft touch.

There's a likable cast fronting up the pic, with Chris Pratt as the hero carrying some olde adventure chops about him, and Bryce Dallas Howard (her natural beauty sparkling on Blu-ray) a fun femme side-kick. The writers introduce a couple of new mighty monsters to the series, hell of beasties for sure, while the photography, stunt work and musical score all impress greatly.

The Velociraptor plot line is crummy and daft, almost as daft as Bryce's high heels character arc, and the familiarity factor does grate a little at times, but it's a rollicking good time not to be taken remotely seriously like it's some sort of series disgrace. 7/10 "
kendsley2003@yahoo.com,"All in all this movie brought back the franchise that started out and captured the worlds attention. From the T-Rex chasing them down the road in there jeep to the velociraptors stalking them and picking them off one by one. 

Jurassic World brought the franchise back to the state of reality. (If dinosaurs were real, this would be the set up for a park and containment of dinosaurs).

Chris Pratt did a great job on not only playing his part but looking it as well. Mis. Howard did ok. It seemed like she stumbled through most of her scenes and didn't bring key emotional expressions or reactions to the scene moments. But with her OCD and control issues played up against Mr. Pratt it brought the key relationship to tie the movie together. 

This is a must see movie!"
aptaunk,Not bad
mattwilde123,"Well choreographed action set-pieces. Good effects. Dinosaurs are magnificent.

Annoyingly cliched characters. Stupid story. I thought the idea of commercialism and ethics could have and should have been explored better. A character talks about never being able to match the first part which is true. Not sure if they were trying to be funny or just self-referentially depressing.

Chris Pratt was good. Everyone else was pointless.

No where near the first. I would even prefer to watch Jurassic Park 3 than this.

★★"
Bulletproof5FDP,"**Jurassic World: A Jurassic Disappointment**

As a fan of the Jurassic Park franchise, especially the first movie, I am quite disappointed with Jurassic World. I was honestly super stoked for the long-awaited sequel to Jurassic Park, but in the end, the movie lacked the charm and mysticism from Jurassic Park. From poorly-developed characters (with the exception of Chris Pratt's Owen Grady) to idiotic plot elements, Jurassic World's only saving grace is the fact that it's a sequel to Jurassic Park. 

The dinosaurs honestly look awful and pale in comparison to the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. The CGI is so obvious and doesn't look realistic at all. Jurassic Park found the right balance of practical effects and computer-generated imagery, giving viewers the feeling that the dinosaurs feel so life-like. Jurassic World basically uses minimal practical effects in favor of CGI galore. It's sad that a 1993 movie has better CGI than a movie made in 2015.

Claire and her nephews Gray and Zach, are cheap imitations of John Hammond and his grandchildren Tim and Lex. Claire is primarily motivated by greed and exploiting the dinosaurs. Hoskins just wants to use the dinosaurs as military weapons. Dr. Henry Wu is a bit more antagonistic, revealed to be secretly creating hybrids for Hoskins as military weapons. The only character that's given some form of development is Owen Grady, played by Star-Lord a.k.a Chris Pratt. His motivations are for researching Velociraptor behavior and actually treats the dinosaurs like living creatures and not just exploited science experiments. Honestly the only redeeming factor throughout the entire movie.

The Indominus Rex tricks the personnel into thinking it's escaped confinement by clawing away at the top of its enclosure. They somehow believe the dinosaur escaped, but wouldn't security be alerted right away? The enclosure doesn't come equipped with bells and whistles? To much surprise (not), the Indominus is actually inside the enclosure with them. This idiotic plot choice allows the Indominus to escape.

Zack and Grey revisiting the original site of Jurassic Park brought back so many nostalgic memories of Jurassic Park. One of the best moments of the entire movie, absolutely loved when they picked up the Jurassic Park banner and the goggles used by Tim. But what killed the moment was when they managed to get the original Jeep started. It's been sitting for over 20 years, non-operational. But for plot convenience, they learned how to fix vehicles previously. 

I thought the assault upon the park attendees by the pterosaurs was chilling, swooping up people in the process. Gave a sense of terror that you could actually feel. One of those people being Zara, Claire's assistant. She is attacked by a pteranodon and then eventually eaten alive by the mosasaurus. Her death was just way too drawn out and totally undeserving. A death like this should have been reserved for the villain.

The final battle between the Indominus Rex and Owen's pack of surviving Velociraptor brought me back to the battle between the T-Rex and raptors in Jurassic Park. Then Claire brings out the T-Rex, the very same one from Jurassic Park, and manages to outrun the T-Rex IN HEELS. I was rooting for the T-Rex to win, then the Mosasaurus swoops up and drags the Indominus into the lagoon. 

Though this movie attempts to bring back the Jurassic Park charm, it ultimately fails to capture that same magic. Unlike The Force Awakens, another similar movie that calls back to its roots, Jurassic World managed to be much worse than its source material. You feel no true connection to the characters or dinosaurs, the excitement factor is gone, and the music is not memorable at all. 

My Rating: 5.5/10.0"
Gimly,"Most assuredly the best sequel to _Jurassic Park_, but it doesn't touch the original. ""Not being as good as a different movie"" is not what's bad about _Jurassic World_ though, what is though is the dropped plotlines, unlikeable characters, haphazard mixing of respect and disrespect for the original at random intervals, a **complete** lack of chemistry between any two characters whatsoever, but most of all the romantic leads, underdeveloped arcs of both characters and story, more Deus Ex Machinas than you can shake a stick at, and some of the most painful dialogue I've seen in a Hollywood flick all year.

But there's Bryce Dallas Howard proving (when given the chance) she's an acting force, which was a particularly pleasant surprise given that the last thing I saw her in was _Spider-Man 3_. Chris Pratt doesn't for a moment make you believe he is anyone other than Chris Pratt, but Chris Pratt is a pretty rad dude so that's more or less a chip in the film's favour.

It also has dinosaurs, so there's that.

_Final rating: ★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
MSB,"MORE REVIEWS @ https://www.msbreviews.com/

Jurassic World remains my second favorite film of the whole saga.

Colin Trevorrow is able to blend the suspenseful traits of the original with a more adventurous, light tone really well. Dinosaurs look amazing, still today. Characters could have benefited from a little more work. Decent story.

Rating: B"
Peter McGinn,"I recently watched the first three movies in this series, for the third time or so, but it occurred to me as I watched this one that I probably watched it only once, if at all.

It brings with it the usual elements of this film franchise: the children (not the thousand extras who run around but two we care about), whose mission is to get themselves into the path of extreme danger; the somewhat evil guy who presumably will also end up being Dino food; raptors who get smarter and stronger with every film; and footage of the original Jurassic theme park in case we are in danger of forgetting its roots.

I try not to notice stuff like how extras can never outrun dinosaurs but the stars always manage it.  It is just entertainment, after all. Let’s not overthink it. And I question whether a company that must be so susceptible to lawsuits in its day to day operation would really create more dangerous creatures because they need new thrill rides. Wouldn’t they be more apt to create more up close and personal rides or experiences with the existing ones? Especially the herbivores? If a customer needs more excitement than standing near a 100-foot tall dinosaur, maybe they need to scale back their drug intake, or go climb Mt. Everest. But again, I don’t want to overthink this thing. It was watchable enough, just not thought provoking or revolutionary."
mooney240,"**Jurassic World captures the delight and suspense of the original films while adding a fantastic new cast, an epic new park, and bigger, scarier dinosaurs.**

Jurassic World perfectly blends the nostalgia of the original movies with a new grand scale, incredible effects, and big stars. Hollywood’s flood of reboots and remakes rarely capture the heart and quality of the original source, but Jurassic World stands out as one of the best. Chris Pratt’s tough and lovable rogue, Owen Grady, brings the action. At the same time, Bryce Dallas Howard’s high-stung and successful business executive, Claire Dearing, grows and develops from selfish career focus to respecting nature and valuing family. Every scene feels grandiose and epic, with a bigger park, bigger attractions, and bigger dinosaurs. The childlike wonder still shines through, with kids giddy at a dino petting zoo and crowds cheering as the Mosasaurus feeds on a great white shark. The scares are back, too, with deadlier predators and plenty of hapless park employees to hunt. While the Jurassic series has its ups and downs, Jurassic World is at its peak!"
Travis Bell,"Skyfall was a solid movie in its own right but as a Bond movie, it was one of my all time favourites. Unlike Quantum of Solace, I felt like they actually took the time to tell this story and the pay off was worth it.

Something I found interesting is the idea about Bond getting old and how the job of an MI6 agent is not something you can do forever. It makes me wonder if they might explore some of these themes in the next movie.

It's true that the last 1/3 of Skyfall didn't feel like a Bond movie at all and I think that's why I loved it. The Daniel Craig Bond movies have always taken a different look at James Bond and Skyfall was no exception.

Like I said, great movie. Execution on all accounts were solid like you'd expect. I hope Mendes gets a chance to do the next film."
GeekMasher,"Skyfall is a great movie. In my opinion the best proformas by Daniel Craig I have see in all his Bond movies. The title song was not to my taste like in previous movies. The story line is one of the most compelling I have seen in a while. Silva, played by Javier Bardem was excellent and he played him very well. All in all a very good movie."
Kenneth Axel Carlsson,"Bond (Daniel Craig) is on another (important) mission somewhere in the big world, this time on the heels of someone who has stolen a hard drive with all the names of the British agents who work for MI6. On the mission, Mr. Bond is shot by one of his own (an agent named Eve, played by Naomie Harris) and presumed dead. However, Bond is not dead, and when he resurfaces, he jumps right into the game in the pursuit of an old agent called Silva (Javier Bardem), an old favorite of M (Judi Dench).

While Bond is out in the world, M discovers that someone, presumably Silva, has hacked their computers and threats to expose the true names of the British agents. However, it is also clear that the enemy has other plans, plans of terrorism. Bond is now in a race against time before more agents are revealed, or worse yet, before M is killed by their mysterious enemy. Fortunately, everything works out perfectly for 007, who finds the mysterious Silva with little effort.

OK, admittedly, this was a very short summary of the plot in Skyfall, but in all honesty, there isn't a big plot in this movie. I could have given some spoilers about the ending, and maybe added a bit about Mallory (Ralph fiennes), but really, this is an extremely simple plot. Not at all worthy of a big iconic character like James Bond.

It is classic 007, with everything thats part of such an adventure, like product placement (not a favorite of mine, in fact I get rather annoyed when its as obvious as the watch in the opening of the movie), car chases (in this case, more like a motorcycle chase across the roofs of some unknown city), beautiful women (which are exactly as shallow and pointless as you would expect), and lastly a total lack of emotions and realism.

I am not a big Bond fan, and haven't seen all of the movies in the series, so I am probably not the right person to review this movie. I do not understand what it is that draws people into the cinema time after time, to watch yet another Bond movie… when they can watch something original with a real plot and real characters. Perhaps these people like the shallow characters, who care little for the safety of the innocent people in the world, yes, I said it. Look carefully in the opening sequence, how the female agent cares little for the people on the bridge, as she shoots after the enemy. Later in that scene, she finds it really hard to shoot the enemy, because what if she hit Bond instead. I may be wrong in this assumption, but isn't MI6 here to protect the innocent people? Perhaps these people like the almost infinite number of one-liners that made my ears bleed at one point. Why are we treated this way? Do the people who makes these movies really think we are so stupid?

Before I actually say something nice about Skyfall, because I can do that, I just want to give a small piece of advice to future Bond villains, because who are we kidding, there will be more Bond movies in the future… my advice is this: Always remember to close the door behind you, whether its an actual door, or maybe a manhole (cover). If you don't do this, Bond will surely find you. But of course, perhaps you are dying to have him on your tail, in which case, you are doing it exactly right!

OK, something positive. Skyfall is a beautiful movie, in a very obvious (and superficial) way. The colors are just stunning, especially when we follow Bond swimming through the night of Shanghai, high above the streets. There is no denying the imagery and action of the movie, in every possible way, this is some of the best the world has to offer. I'd also like to give a shout out to Albert Finney, whose character (Kincade) raises the quality of the movie, and actually give it some human emotion.

The very last thing I want to say is this… why hire Sam Mendes for this movie? Why hire him when he is not allowed to use the powers that God have given him? Where are the human emotions, where are the dark humor, where are the personal stories that capture our hearts as much as our minds? If you want to watch a real Sam Mendes movie, I suggest the following American Beauty, Jarhead and even, Revolutionary Road.

_Last words... only watch this movie if you have nothing to do… at all… and if you are a hardcore fan of 007 and feel forced to watch every movie in the franchise. This movie reminds me why I only rarely watch big Hollywood blockbusters._"
John Chard,"How safe do you feel?

Bond 23 and 007 has to literally come back from the dead when a stolen hard-drive makes M (Dench) look bad at a time when a face from her past comes homing into blood thirsty view. 

There is one sure fire fact in cinema that nobody can dispute, that of there never ever being a James Bond film that all Bondphiles will agree on. From each corner of the spectrum will come arguments that said Bond film is not gritty enough, not fun enough, not enough sex, not enough action, not enough fantastical stunts and etc etc etc. Well that's fine of course, we all have our peccadilloes we prefer in our Bond movies, but we do live in different times now, the world has changed, and so has Bond. You may not get the ultimate Bond you want, but this is a 21st Century Bond and a new era of 007 is upon us, something which makes Skyfall even the more bolder and braver because it marks the 50th anniversary by blending the old with the new and mostly achieving brilliant results. 

Skyfall allows us to bathe in nostalgia whilst also forcing us to re- evaluate just where we are at in terms of our beloved super secret agent. One of the great things about this Bond is that there is a bubbling under current of time's importance delicately perched on each side of James Bond's shoulders. Is he (and M etc) outdated? Or is the future still in need of such operatives/organisations? Director Mendes and his team don't take any of the easy options that were clearly available to them to answer the question, they instead build a film around Bond and M as characters, embrace the traditions of the series and hit us hard in head and heart. 

The plot of Skyfall as written is simple, absolutely nailed on it is straight and true to Hollywood conventions, but what fills out the simple plot is a series of Bondian delights, thrills spills and emotionally splintered kills. The stunning pre-credits sequence sees Bond traverse the rooftops of Istanbul on a motorcycle and then fight on top of a speeding train. Only to then find himself expendable. Which leads to Daniel Kleinman's title credits sequence that is filled with ominous portents of death and blood, in turn backed by the wonderfully Bondian of old title song warbled by Adele. It's clear at this point that this Bond movie is nodding to traditional values whilst promising to deliver some emotional pain. And so it proves. 

A washed up Bond enters the fray, and he convinces, he's dishevelled, unshaven and unfit, but he's still a tough bastard who can drink hard and stare a scorpion down. He'll be back soon, we know this, and he will be in wonderful physical shape, and loyal to his surrogate mother for sure. Ah, but there's the adversary on the scene now, a villain to finally give Craig's Bond something to fret about. It's Javier Bardem's (perfect) Silva, a cyber terrorist with a shock of blonde hair, a nasty dental trick and a devilish sexiness that unnerves during an interrogation scene; to which Bond cheekily opens up some wink wink possibilities. There is other sexual tension in the film as well, not just a steamy shower scene, but the ongoing banter with Naomie Harris' (excellent) Eve that positively fizzes with smirking innuendo. 

But ultimately this comes down to the love between a man and a woman, the kind that is so different to the type that has so often underpinned a Bond movie. Bond will kill or be killed for M, and how marvellous to see a director really able to give Judi Dench the direction she so deserves, and Bond, in Craig's magnetic and gritty hands, responds in kind to deliver a last half hour as good as any in the 50 years of Bond on film. As we know, all turf is Bond's turf, but this time it really is HIS turf, and as a little back story comes seeping out, Bond gets to exorcise some demons whilst kicking considerable ass. Get ready Bondphiles, this has the emotional wallop only seen in the best Bond movies of old. 

All the Bondian trappings are still here, exotic locales, gorgeous women, speeding vehicles, fights, stupendous stunts, bizarre lairs and balls out machismo. It's also funny! I myself commented when reviewing Quantum of Solace that it was pretty ace as an action film, but for many it's not Bondian enough, and the truth of the matter is Bond still needs to have a degree of fun, no matter how grim and gritty the story line is. Thankfully Skyfall is often a blast, with Craig (surely convincing even the most stubborn of dissenters how good a Bond he is) having the confidence and skill to lace his Bond's macho broody instinct with a desert dry wit and shrug of the shoulders nonchalance. Other side of the camera the tech credits are high, with Deakins proving to be one of the aces in the pack. His capturing of vistas, be it a neon city scape or a mountainous valley, are eye delights, his colour tones are beautiful, I promise you, nobody these days does golden browns like Deakins. 

It's not the masterpiece that I or gazillions of others hoped for, and it does have flaws (new Q a bit too geeky safe, finale lacks a substantial battle with the villain) and it remains simple in plot, but it's Bond's birthday and the birthday boy has been done proud by the makers. It's a new era Bond for sure, but that most definitely isn't a bad thing, it knows its past and it now knows its future, and without doubt we all still know the name. 9/10"
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"Me and my oldest son have been doing a bit of pseudo binge watching of James Bond. Every weekend we have been watching two of the movies starting with Dr. No quite a few weekends ago. Last weekend we arrived at the Daniel Craig ones. I had actually not watched those ones before. I have to, grudgingly (I am a Sean Connery fan), admit that the first two we watched were not at all bad.

However, today we watched Skyfall. What the f…? This is not a James Bond movie! If it had been just some other movie I would probably have thought it would not be a too bad one. However, it pretends to be a James Bond movie and as such it is utter crap. It is a bloody Hollywood drama written by someone with a total lack of respect for the Franchise, not to mention the old Bond fans.

James Bond should be out hunting international villains. Villains with a good chunk of bad guy charisma I might add. What we got however was some loathsome prick having a grudge because M didn’t come to his rescue when he fucked up.

The British Secret service should also be just that, a powerful organisation protecting Britain (and the rest of the civilized world) from communists, terrorists, criminal superorganisations like Spectre or whatever.  Having scenes with M more or less on trial and having to defend herself in front of a bunch of clueless political asshats is just crap and it is definitely not the kind of crap that should be in a James Bond movie.

The whole movie is just full of sensationalist shit, politically correct crap, killing of popular characters, sentimental bullshit and other nonsens of the kind you would expect in a bloody Hollywood soap opera. And what about the new Q? A boring brat with a over-inflated ego. Not fun at all.

Even the special effects are debatable. For example, if you make a subway train crash by blowing a hole in it’s path then for Christ sake put some crash test dummies or something in it to at least make some pretense of it not being an empty mock-up!

This is undoubtedly the worst Bond movie ever. My disappointment with this movie cannot be overstated."
JPV852,"Great theme song and a much more balanced movie compared to Quantum of Solace, and the story is well written, revealing Bond's background and the motherly relationship with M (contrast with a more antagonistic portrayal in the Brosnan series). Javier Bardem as the villain was fantastic, almost Joker like in his planning. The only setback is the finale, sure some nice action and explosions but not quite as thrilling versus Casino Royale. Still, one of the better in the Bond series overall. **4.0/5**"
Wuchak,"_**Can you go home again?**_

After 007 (Daniel Craig) is thought dead-in-action in Turkey, the computer of ‘M’ (Judi Dench) is hacked and there’s an attack on the MI6 headquarters in London. M & Bond suspect it’s an inside job, which leads James to Shanghai, Macao and a mysterious island off the coast of China, then back to London. Bond has to find sanctuary for M, but you know what they say about going home again? Javier Bardem plays a heavy and Ralph Fiennes an MI6 official.

“Skyfall” (2012) thankfully includes the character depth of “Casino Royale” (2006) and fixes the confusing 4 clips-per-second action of “Quantum of Solace” (2008). Don’t get me wrong, “Quantum” can be appreciated as the action-oriented second half of “Casino Royale,” but it’s easily one of the lesser installments in the franchise. “Skyfall,” by contrast, stands with the best.

The movie saves the best for last, but I don’t want to give anything away. Let’s just say it’s a refreshing change for the series, the locations are fabulous and a classic actor unexpectedly shows up.  

Besides Dench on the feminine front, there’s Bérénice Marlohe as Severine in China and Naomie Harris as MI6 agent Eve. Tonia Sotiropoulou also has a brief scene in Turkey.

The film runs 2 hours, 23 minutes, and was shot in Turkey, England, China and Scotland.

MSB,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/skyfall-spoiler-free-review

""Skyfall is not only the entry that this James Bond saga needed, but it's my favorite movie of the Daniel Craig Era. From the exceptionally intriguing narrative filled with shocking developments to Javier Bardem's terrifying portrayal of a fascinating antagonist, Sam Mendes offers his remarkable directing skills to create a film worthy of much praise.

The GOAT of cinematography, Roger Deakins, makes every inch of the screen drip cinematic beauty with eyegasmic wide shots and mind-blowing lighting, making this the best-looking Bond flick ever. Technically, it's challenging to find elements less than simply perfect.

Phenomenal acting all-around elevates an extraordinarily impactful character work, culminating in an emotionally powerful third act. A slightly overextended runtime doesn't stop me from considering this a flawless Bond movie.

I can't endorse it more than this.""

Rating: A"
CinemaSerf,"Ok, first things first. ""Skyfall"" and ""crumble"" do not rhyme. Sorry Adele, but they don't! Luckily, the rest of this story is almost as good as ""Casino Royale"" (2006). Daniel Craig reprises his role as ""007"", this time charged with thwarting a dastardly plan by the enigmatic ""Silva"" to avenge himself on none other than ""M"" (Dame Judi Dench) herself. He has managed to successfully infiltrate just about every system MI6 has and obtain a list of agents the world over. When he starts publishing these names, and the body count starts to rise, it falls to ""Bond"" to engage with his clever and malevolent foe. Bardem is effective as the baddie here. He has a certain, almost menacing, effeteness as he quite literally toys with his quarry. Loads of gadgets, explosions, a welcome appearance from the original Aston Martin and an action-packed pace keep this moving along well. The ending is a bit far-fetched, even by ""James Bond"" standards, and that even though it did give us chance to enjoy a suitably eclectic contribution from Albert Finney, was all just bit daft. The supporting efforts don't bode so well, either. Ralph Fiennes seems set for a larger role in future films and he doesn't really add much and though she does well enough, the role offered to Naomie Harris' ""Eve"" is just too insubstantial for her to assert herself on much of the story. That said, though, it's very much at the top end of the Craig outings for this character and it does look good on big screen,"
mooney240,"**Skyfall understands, admires, and elevates Bond to excellence and mastery to an unexpected level and unmatched by its predecessors.**

Skyfall is The Dark Knight of Daniel Craig’s James Bond films. Sam Mendes took all Casino Royale had built and elevated it to heights never before reached by Bond. Everything fires perfectly on all cylinders. The story is rich and delves further into the character of a bond than ever before. The action set pieces, the locales, and the cinematography are all masterpieces that establish Skyfall as an excellent James Bond film but take it further, placing it among the best movies of all time. Judi Dench’s performance as M cements her legacy as a Bond great. And the excellent supporting cast grows with the brilliant casting and performances of Naomi Harris as Moneypenny, Ralph Fiennes as Mallory, and Ben Whishaw as Q. Still, the biggest standout is Javier Bardem as the villainous Silva - one of the greatest Bond antagonists of all time. His unpredictable and menacing nature is cloaked in a slightly goofy demeanor and skewed moral code. Skyfall asks and answers questions unlike any Bond before while staying true to what makes James Bond so compelling and entertaining. Just like The Dark Knight for Batman, even people who are not traditional Bond fans will be impressed with Skyfall."

Tragically I am a Batman. An obsessive Caped Crusader comic-book collector until 1972 when my evil mother tossed the entire bunch in the garbage. My cousin was Spider-man. His noble mother preserved his collection with plastic envelopes and to this day they remain in pristine condition. 

What's truly tragic about being a Batman is that, despite Nolan's recent attempts (and questionable sincerity), the best Batman movie hasn't been made yet. As far as we know, with Batman's fate resting with Warner Bros, David Goyer, Zak Snider and Ben Affleck, the best Batman movie will not be possible for another decade or two, maybe three. I await thee Dark Knight.

Again to my cousin's good fortune, the best movie about Spider-man has been established for quite some time. In fact, as a benchmark, it is arguably the best comic-book super-hero movie ever made. I didn't much love Sam Raimi's first Spider-man, and wished my mother could have disposed of his last entry, but _Spider-Man 2_ was, and is, the ultimate movie adaptation from comic-books to the movie screen. 

I was living in Shanghai in the summer of 2004 where I had to commute 3 hours on a hot and dizzy day to see it in English, and was fully rewarded for the effort. I was thrust into a imaginary super-hero world far more pleasing than anything I could remember since childhood. The 3 hour commute back home seemed like a breeze because Spider-man 2 awoke the wonder-struck boy inside me. It reminded me of a happy youth I forgot I had. It felt like Spidey was on the subway with me and would protect me from any harm. And he was just a boy himself! Batman? Who's that?

For a super-hero story, nearly everything is perfect in this movie. Doc Ock couldn't have been better. He looked exactly the way he did, at the height of Stan Lee's eminence, in the brightly coloured panels fighting Spider-man in 1968. And sounded just like I imagined he would. Peter and Mary Jane were in their element and their friendship and romantic undertaking actually mattered. The story and action played out the way a comic book should. It was both intimate and fantastic. Trippy, wonderful and scary. It was like growing up all over again. The climax was a bit too flashy, loud and over-the-top at that time, but by today's standards, when compared to climactic train-wrecks in _Man of Steel_, _Iron Man 3_ and _The Avengers_, it's perfectly splendid.

We are now being helplessly bombarded with comic book movies attacking us from every direction, all of them trying to out-do each other, jumping one shark after another. Every marginal superhero from Dr Strange to Shazam is being dusted off and hurled onto the big screen for our insatiable happy-childhood-appeasing appetite. The Marvel of Disney is launching at us one theme-park roller-coaster ride after another. Sony, with their Amazing Spider-man abominations, has completely lost it. Fox's X-Men and Fantastic Four proliferations hit the wall long ago. And DC, under the reigns of Warner Bros, has transfigured into its own worst enemy. A wretched mutation not even the Joker finds amusing.

Turns out Sam Raimi's _Spider-Man 2_ is the gold standard by which all comic-book movies, certainly those of the super-hero variety, are and, evidently, will be set. Lucky cousin."
tmdb44006625,"I don't think anyone can review this movie better than what Roger Ebert said about it back in 2004: ""It's a real movie, full-blooded and smart, with qualities even for those who have no idea who Stan Lee is. It's a superhero movie for people who don't go to superhero movies, and for those who do, it's the one they've been yearning for.""

I also don't think any film has so eloquently defined a hero the way Aunt May does in a wonderfully heartfelt and poignant scene half way through the film.

I do think the villain of Doctor Octopus is underdeveloped in both logic and motivation (although Alfred Molina is great), Mary Jane Watson is too dependent on the men in her life, and the friendship arc between Peter and Harry is a bit contrived, but none of these flaws affect what is otherwise a beautifully constructed film and a worthy sequel to the original."
Justin Lopez,Sony did a great job of focusing on what really matters in this movie - the character. Here we see a relatable Peter Parker who can't seem to catch a break and when he does it just feels so satisfying to watch him rise up from all the challenges he faced.
LoganWright,It was amazing to see what they did to Harry's character. He went from being Peter's best friend to mortal enemy. I can't blame him though cause what do you expect would happen if you found out your best friend was the one who killed your father?
BradleyStewart,"Is it me or does MJ get more and more annoying with every film? Still a 10/10 film for me because I'm not here for her, I'm here for my boy, Peter Parker!"
JessieCollins,"To me, it felt like what Uncle Ben imparted to Peter in the first film - with great power comes great responsibility - was the very essence of this film. He had too much power, too much responsibility, and he needed to find a way to balance all of that."
John Smith,You're not a real Spider-Man fan if you haven't watched this.
1RobertJohnson1,I was completely blown away! The 11-year-old in me definitely connected with this film on another level and made me remember just how much I loved superheroes.
WilliamJones,Big shoutout to Tobey Maguire for giving so much life and soul to Peter Parker. I can't imagine anyone else doing so well like he did.
DavidBrown1,You can definitely feel the effort that the studio put into every scene in the movie.
richardmiller,"Tobey Maguire did a great job making Peter Parker a young man that you would feel for, wince with, and watch slowly as he turns from this young boy into a man."
ThomasMoore,This is one of the OG films that paved the way for the superhero films of today. I can't express how thankful I am for Tobey Maguire for being the pioneer!
JeffreyYoung,Definitely a fan's dream-come-true! Studios of today should take notes from films like this if they want to produce a successful superhero film.
JacobKing1,"Here in this movie, we see more of the human side of Spider-Man and saw how this boy turned into a man trying his best to fulfill his responsibilities being a human and superhero at the same time."
NicholasLopez,I thoroughly enjoyed it and I think it's one of the most engrossing superhero movies there is.
StephenScott,"I really, really appreciate that they highlight character development and storyline more than the fight scenes."
LarryAdams,A surprisingly outstanding sequel to the first Spider-Man film.
JustinCampbell,"All the action, comedy, and drama had such a delicate balance. It's pretty amazing to see such a precise blend of these emotions in a superhero film."
CharlesTaylor,"If you ask me, this is leaps and bounds better than the Superhero films - even the Batman films. Spider-Man is that person anyone can relate to. He has such a big human side to him that it's hard not to resonate with him."
ChristopherAndersen,Wanna see what a flawless film looks like? Go see this one now!
DoryDarko,"There can be many reasons why the original director of a franchise may decide not to return for a sequel, though they all usually have in common that they're very Hollywood-politically-correct. So exactly why Jon Favreau decided not to helm the third instalment of what is, for all intents and purposes, 'his baby' Iron Man, I can't be sure. But I can tell you one thing: something definitely changed.

Everything about IM3 feels different from its predecessors. The atmosphere is darker, which is not to say it's really just a lot less humorous (which is – let's be honest – precisely what we love about Iron Man). The new characters are terribly underdeveloped and overall it's just a great deal less interesting. The storyline was completely vague to me; I'm still not really sure what the whole point of it was. And probably the biggest flaw of all – the first two films had really cool, interesting villains. This one's just really quite weird and not charismatic at all. Possibly at the core of the problem is the fact that it wasn't just one bad guy, it was many. The leading roles are shared by Guy Pearce and Sir Ben Kingsley, and – big shock – it was the latter who disappointed me the most. Not only was his role quite small, I thought it was also incredibly lame. I'd love to explain to you why, but that would be a major spoiler. I noticed some people in the audience laughing at the plot twist of Kingsley's character, but I thought it was just completely stupid and weak, and a total waste of such a great actor. Pearce is not bad, but never really manages to elevate his villain to a higher level, largely because he had zero character development to work with. Same thing with Rebecca Hall. Or the rest of Pearce's cronies for that matter... Too many to count. Sigh.

Well, at least we still have Robert Downey Jr. He's as reliable as ever when it comes to carrying a film, but even he can't help it that his character is almost boring in this one. Where's the humour!? Where's the cynicism we all know and love?! Where's Tony bloody Stark! This is not the familiar overconfident, pompous macho we adore. All of a sudden, and for NO apparent reason whatsoever, this guy is insecure and suffering from anxiety attacks! What the F! Not to mention the fact that his superhero alter ego is almost completely absent for half of the film, because he's off somewhere in the middle of Tennessee finding himself or whatever... I mean, geez... I know the director left, but didn't any of the screenwriters return either? The fact that Pepper Potts had only about two minutes of relevant screen time also certainly didn't help. And when she was there, she was humourless and annoying. Big sigh.

The more I think about it, the more I'm having a hard time trying to think of good things to say about this film. At least the visual effects were solid, and the sound effects were awesome.

This was actually the first time I've seen a film in 3D. I've always avoided it because I was sure that it would be a complete distraction from the story. Turns out I was right in my assumption. I found it hard to focus on what was really going on, and this might have definitely been an influence in trying to follow the plot, so there's a big chance I missed a few things. Nevertheless, I can't help being very disappointed with Iron Man 3, especially since I love the first two so much.

This is definitely a filmmakers' case of ""could've, would've, should've"". They obviously tried very hard, but never quite manage to get there.

No story, no interesting characters, no filler. Nothing. Too bad.

tmdb55636115,"This was probably the first time a movie has made me this angry in the theater.  It pissed me off then and it still pisses me off when it's on television.  If I could summarize this film in one word, it would be: obnoxious.  I wasn't really hyped for this film but I was expecting to have some fun since I did enjoy the previous Iron Man films.  This was the movie that made me start to dislike the character of Tony Stark/Iron Man (RDJ is still the man though).  Stark's narcissism had charm in the previous films but here, it made him into a complete idiot, dick, and coward. The Mandarin had potential to be an effective villain but the movie scraps him for a more lame villain than Justin Hammer from Iron Man 2.  The comedy was forced and annoying and the story has plot holes that were distracting.  I watched Thor 2 a while after this released but the taste from this movie was so bitter that even though I thought Thor 2 was alright, I just didn't want to see anymore films from this cinematic universe.  This movie is what killed the MCU for me."
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed by this third instalment of the Iron Man series of movies. Sure Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark is quite funny (not always but a lot of the time) and there are plenty of nice special effects and things being blown up.

However, the story is just crap. The premise of Killian using the Mandarin for terrorism to cover up the fact that his experiments occasionally fails is just ludicrous. The Mandarin himself is a joke and another good example of how ignorant script writers just pick names out of existing material and uses them not caring how much they screw up established characters and world building already done. Whoever wrote this script should be ashamed of himself.

What is worse, the entire movie is very anti-Iron-Man. It starts right of with Stark being obsessed by his Iron Man suits and a lot of harping about him stopping being Iron Man. Most of the time Stark is running around without his suit and the few times he is in it then the suit does not work properly or is shot off him almost immediately. Actually, most of Stark’s cool stuff is just shot to hell most of the time. 

The end is full of fireworks but again, it is mostly a display in how you can destroy Iron Man suits and some more anti-Iron-Man crap.

I cannot say that I did not enjoy watching the fireworks and special effects but as a whole I am disappointed with this movie."
Gimly,"**A long form review originally posted in 2013**

_Iron Man 3_ brings us into the so called “Phase 2” of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But it does so in a flawed way. I’ve said it before and reiterate it here, there is no such thing as a perfect film. But since _The Avengers_ set the bar so very high, following that up proved to simply be too much for Black’s entry to handle.

There are a great deal of inconstancies, plot holes, stupid moves, illogical choices, and weak moments (though less than much of the internet would have you believe). These issues are not enough to lead to _Iron Man 3’s_ complete and utter downfall, but they do force a sour taste into the piece overall.

This isn’t to say it’s a bad movie though. In fact it’s actually quite good. It surpasses the quality of _Iron Man 2_ and plants itself firmly in the MCU rather successfully. A move which only _The Incredible Hulk_ failed to make, but still. Yes it has its problems, yes we’d hoped for better, and yes I’ve got complaints, but the movie is not at all a failure. Manages to come full circle in a way that still leaves Tony Stark & Iron Man a future in the Marvel Universe.

Shane Black and Drew Pearce manage to bring in a sense of vulnerability that was barely touched on in the past MCU works. Even the minuscule Steve Rogers of _Captain America_ seemed in control of every situation. But here we see Tony Stark as not only a breakable man, but a man in general. The most human of any Super Hero appearance in the MCU to date. Yes the Robert Downey Jr. wit that all have come to expect from the piece is still on the table, but in between and beneath that there’s an insomniac with extreme anxiety disorders living separated from the real world, too invested in his work and shattered identity to live as the Stark everyone expects him to still be.

Pepper and Rhodey are even given a chance to pick up the slack. The three form this sort of protagonist trinity, Saving one another in a round-robin Super Hero-y way with a little more depth than I’d expected.

The _Iron Man_ movies famously have had the most disappointing bad-guy-show-downs in the genre. And though here Black gives us much more of a delivery on this front than Favreau ever did, the issues I had with _Iron Man 3_ came (almost) exclusively from A.I.M, the Mandarin and Extremis (which form the antagonist trinity now that I think of it).

So, we’ve got better a better final confrontation, but from less integral bad guys. A more human hero, stuck in a less human adventure. A better interlocking of characters, with less to do on screen. I could go on with this roller coaster, but that word essentially sums up the film. Not in that its a cliched “thrill ride”, but in that it’s a constant mess of ups and downs, with the final destination just barely justifying the start point.

Speaking non-comparitively, _Iron Man 3_ makes a good movie. Not great. But so very, very worth the watch. It’s hard for me to think objectively separate from the other films in the MCU, because I’ve seen them all so many times that there’s no way for me to forget all that’s come before when watching the movie. I’d be interested to hear from somebody who’s watched _Iron Man 3_, but not _Iron Man 1_ & _2_ or _The Avengers_. I’m sure such a person exists somewhere, and if so your input would be greatly appreciated.

I think I might have made it seem as if I disliked Iron Man 3 more than I actually did. Here’s why. From _Iron Man 2_ until _The Avengers_, I watched all the MCU films in cinemas. After each one, I immediately got that feeling of wanting to go back and watch it again, a feeling that steadily grew as time passed. Each film that Marvel released had me feeling this more strongly than the last, culminating in _The Avengers_ which I saw six times in theatres, and immediately pre-ordered the whole set on Blu-Ray the moment it became available (I bought a PS3 for the sole purpose of watching them). But with _Iron Man 3_ I sort of dropped back to a pretty low interest level once I’d left Hoyts. It seemed that although it was a really good watch, it just didn’t have the staying power I’d come to expect from these incredible Super Hero films.

tmdb44006625,"I don't understand the hate for this one. The fact that Tony Stark is barely in the suit makes for an interesting take on analyzing the humanity of the character. I also found the villain plot twist halfway through the movie to be quite clever and surprisingly satisfying.

It certainly feels more like a Shane Black movie than an Iron Man movie, but that's a great thing. It shows Marvel is willing to give their filmmakers a voice and the room to take risks in their storytelling. Iron Man 3 is a very risky movie, and to me it paid off."
JPV852,"When I first saw this in 2013, strongly disliked it but decided to give it another watch during my re-visit of the MCU and... kind of enjoyed it, quite a bit. Still not fond of the twist wasting  a great actor in Ben Kingsley to be a decoy Mandarin and instead having a cheesy one with Guy Pearce's Aldrich Killian and his lame ""I AM THE MANDORIAN!"" line. But all in all, a good step up from Iron Man 2. **3.75/5**"
r96sk,"Very good.

<em>'Iron Man 3'</em> offers an entertaining 130 minutes. I enjoyed seeing the plot unfold, it isn't anything revolutionarily fresh but it's done in a way that's interesting to watch. The score and effects are great.

Robert Downey Jr. continues to be a lot of fun as the lead, while Don Cheadle is more enjoyable than he is in <em>'Iron Man 2'</em>. Guy Pearce and Ben Kingsley are good to watch too, the latter amused me more than I thought he would.

I'd rank this higher than the 2010 sequel, though it's still a fair distance off the original. This 2013 film leaves a positive impression."
Wuchak,"_**Worthwhile, but a bit of a letdown compared to the snappy ""Iron Man 2""**_

Released in 2013, ""Iron Man 3"" stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark in this third installment where Shellhead takes on the so-called Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) and A.I.M. (Advanced Idea Mechanics), led by Killian (Guy Pearce). After Stark's personal world is destroyed, he is left to survive by relying on his ingenuity and instincts to rise from the ashes and protect those closest to him, like Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow). In the process Tony seeks to answer a question that has haunted him: Does the suit of armor make the man or does the man make the suit of armor? Don Cheadle and Jon Favreau are on hand as James Rhodes (War Machine) and Happy Hogan respectively while Rebecca Hall plays an agent of A.I.M.

After the absolutely kinetic (and inexplicably criticized) ""Iron Man 2"" this third part of the trilogy is a bit of a letdown. It's a quality superhero movie, but the first act is lethargic compared to the dynamic initial reel of the previous movie. Things pick up in the second act as Stark is separated from his loved ones and presumed dead, forced to team up with a brainiac kid. While some claim that the movie's ""more serious"" than ""Iron Man 2,"" it has the same tone and the same main characters/cast; the amount of ""more seriousness"" is marginal.

People say ""Iron Man 3"" plays better on repeat viewings, so I'll update this review after future viewings. But I was letdown by the lame representation of the Mandarin, the ambiguous powers of the A.I.M. operatives, the myriad Iron Man suits functioning without a person in them and the fact that everyone and their brother dons the Iron Man armor or parts of it. For instance, Pepper morphs into a veritable superheroine at one point. Nevertheless, it's not bad at all and the cast is great with Rebecca Hall and Guy Pearce effective in their roles.

The movie runs 130 minutes and was shot North Carolina, Southern California and Miami.

GRADE: C+"
Filipe Manuel Dias Neto,"**It's a substantially weaker film than its two predecessors.**

After two frankly good films, I was curious to see what this film would bring to the public, who immediately set out to fill the studio's coffers with their tickets money. Marvel has discovered an excellent financial lode by transposing most of its characters to the cinema, and this film is destined to be a box office success, although the quality is much more questionable.

I'll start with what I usually leave for last: the technical aspects and production values ​​are really excellent and constitute the strongest and most solid point of the film. Directed by Jon Favreau, who has held his chair since the first “Iron Man”, the film has retained most of the crew and core cast, which helps give the trilogy the flavor of a unique work. With a solid bet on more flashy, loud and spectacular action, the film wants to appeal to a young audience that wants something big, where CGI and effects can create authenticity and a sense of danger. The quality of the effects is undeniable, but the excessive action takes a toll on the final set. It looks like a video game, a recurring mistake in these types of movies.

In addition, the film has good cinematography, it was beautifully shot, it is sharp, and it has excellent colors and light. The work of the stuntmen is meritorious, yet regularly forgotten in the minds of viewers. The sets and costumes are very good, especially Tony Stark's house and the various armors from the movie. Another word for the soundtrack, by Dwight Yoakim, which proved to be up to the task without, however, proving to be memorable.

The cast includes most of the names we already know from the previous two films, with Robert Downey Jr. the most relevant for maintaining the leading role. The actor is good, deserves our credit, and I recognize that he tried to give his character a greater maturity and sense of experience. In this film, Stark is a much more mature, traumatized, tired and even fragile man, and his relationship with Pots has become more formal and firm, causing the former playboy to settle down and carry on a serious love relationship. I understand that this may displease some, but the film seems to take place several years after its predecessor, “Iron Man 2”, and makes mention of several events, in the meantime. With excellent technical work and the use of excellent makeup artists, Ben Kingsley shone in the role he was given and which is clearly one of the best of his recent career. Paltrow and Cheadle also leave us a positive record of his work, although it wasn't as intense as one would expect. Favreau, in addition to directing the film, has a brief funny cameo as Happy. But it's Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall we should be worried about: they do what they can, and yet the film didn't give them much of a chance to do more and better.

The biggest problem with this movie is, of course, the plot and writing of the script, dialogues and scenes. Attempts at comedy are very unpleasant, and Stark, who once had almost a barrage of phrases and jokes for all occasions, is now a serious and weary man. The material given to the actors is scarce and does not bring anything really good. In addition, the film has almost no connection with the previous films, and especially “Iron Man 2”, whose events are never really spoken by anyone."
mooney240,"**While the deeper dive into Tony Stark and his past is welcomed, the execution came up a little short compared to Iron Man’s MCU entries.**

Iron Man 3 might be my least favorite of the Iron Man franchise, but it's still a great movie. Iron Man 3 focuses much more on Tony Stark and his trauma following The Avengers rather than on Iron Man and the suit. A large portion of the film and even some action scenes explore who Stark is without the high-tech suit or fancy technology in general. Stark grapples with the fallout of past decisions and has to decide who he is at his core without the money or Iron Man. As expected, the entire cast dazzles in their performances, from Robert Downey Jr. To Don Cheadle to Gwyneth Paltrow, but the true standout is Ben Kingsley's Mandarin. Iron Man 3 is all about Stark's growth and development, and while that's a great idea, its poor villain and lack of actual Iron Man leave the film feeling a little hollow. I still appreciated the movie and its Christmas cheer, but the MCU has far better Iron Man movies and moments to enjoy."
ohlalipop,"I loved the movie. Of course it's a Tim Burton film and Johnny Depp is in the movie so it's already a given. Story wise, I like it that it's different from the usual Alice in Wonderland stories. I hope they Tim Burton will make the original movie though. The montage in the movie looks nice when they did the flashback. I love the colors. Anne Hathaway is great. I felt like watching a real life Disney princess. Of course Helena Bonham Carter is magnificent. With her big head that looks really natural, it adds to her funny character. And then there's Alan Rickman. Although he's just a voice of the caterpillar, once you hear his voice, you'll know it's him and it's a great comfort.


My grade for this movie??? A. Wonderful story. Great cast. A movie that is pleasing to the eyes. I strongly recommend this to children, adults, and anyone in between. A great family movie."
BiGuy,"_TL:DR    
A modern sequel to a classic. Feels like it has a few narrative issues, but it wasn't enough for me to really dislike it. (It gets a 6/10 on the Dragon-Scale, because the Jabberwocky has an amazing design and it's walking looks so off-putting.)_

Alice... who hasn't heard of or watched it at some point? This is a sequel to the original, Alice is now 19 when she returns to Wonderland. Which... she has no obvious memories of, which, for an adventure with the scope she undertook when she was younger, I find a little hard to believe. 

She never acknowledges having any memories of Wonderland until the end of the movie. Which again, strikes me as odd, because even if she would write off her earlier adventure as a dream, you'd still acknowledge having seen it all before, right? Perhaps I'm just overthinking this, but even subconsciously you'd recognize some of the things you see... right?

In any case, Wonderland has gotten a lot darker and has gotten a healthy CGI coating. Which, might not seem super today, but I think it gives everything a very 'this is not reality' vibe. Which works in Underland's favor in my opinion, it's chaotic, lacking in conventional logic and absolutely infused with magic. And it's bizarre denizens all immediately pop out at you, with many strange shapes, weird behavioral tics and tend to defy the laws of physics.

The story is a coming of age story, which is immediately set up in the beginning as Alice is forced into a marriage with someone she barely knows. Something not uncommon for the time it is set in. And during the movie she figures out who she is, someone who'll do things her own way, prophecies and expectations be damned. Despite not being the easiest way, everything still falls into place eventually and the prophecy fulfills itself.

When she comes back to her reality, she turns down her chosen fiancé, gives everyone she's encountered at her engagement party some snappy one-liners, which, they all seem to take in stride. She then takes up her father's passion to establish brave new trade-routes all the way to China. Which, perhaps feels a little _too_ easy. (Considering everyone was calling her father insane for his plans, which she promptly takes a step further.) But then again, this is a story with talking rabbits, a hookah smoking caterpillar and playing card knights, so perhaps I shouldn't take it so seriously.

All in all, a fun watch with a satisfying payoff in the end!"
tmdb44006625,"X3 is a complete disaster. Worst X-Men movie ever. See rant below:

Not only is the Phoenix storyline butchered, but the script rewrites the personalities of its key characters. Since when were Cyclops, Xavier, and Magneto such assholes? Halle Berry's demand for more screentime basically means she shows up in more scenes. Her character has no arc and often says lines that contradict what she said in previous scenes. Rogue has also turned into a whiny sidenote, part of a shoehorned in love triangle, which is disappointing given that the trilogy started from her perspective.

Throwing in as many mutants as you can on the screen, some with powers that would be good if this were an X-Men spoof, but here it's played for absolute seriousness. It also means every character is essentially one note because there's no time to develop anyone. It certainly doesn't help that the movie carelessly removes or kills off half the team from the previous two films. Instead of shocking me, I'm sitting there never sure who I should be rooting for (except for Wolverine).

X3 hurtles through scene after scene to get from one action set piece to another, and at just 93 minutes, there's never any time to process the plot. Of course the movie has to sequel bait with a final scene that suggests everyone will eventually get their powers back. What a way to render the entire movie pointless.

Lastly, this movie cost $215 million to make. Only about a quarter of that money shows up on the screen. The CGI, green screen, and makeup effects are obvious and look horrible. So the movie looks like crap, tells it's story like crap, and treats it's characters like crap. X3 is crap."
Wuchak,"***A good finale to the original trilogy***  

I think the X-Men films have been so popular because the X-Men dare to be different. The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. If you approach the X-Men films thinking you're getting something akin to Superman, Spider-Man or Batman, forget it.

The unique concept of the X-Men is that humanity is starting to evolve to the next level and humans all over the globe are starting to manifest superhuman powers from the mutant ""X"" gene. Two mutant leaders, who are also old friends, take highly contrasting positions. Charles Xavier starts a school for mutant youths in upstate New York. His attitude is positive and his goal benign. Eric Lensherr or Magneto, on the other hand, is fed up with the paranoia of non-mutants. He starts a ""Brotherhood of Mutants"" with a clear attitude of superiority. And, as they say, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

You could say that Xavier takes the approach of Martin Luther King Jr. while Magneto goes the route of Malcolm X, an interesting comparison.

Although everybody has their favorite, I feel all three films in the original trilogy are of the same general quality - ""X-Men"" (2000), ""X2: X-Men United"" (2003) and ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" (2006).

""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is generally well-regarded but has a very vocal segment of fans who revile it. This makes little sense since, despite having a new director, the film has the same tone and principle actors as the previous two and brings to culmination the ideas presented therein. Aside from the final fight between Magneto's Brotherhood and Xavier's X-Men we get the resurrection of Jean Grey and her struggle with the dark side of her psyche.

Some complain of the deaths of two prominent characters, but how often are characters resurrected in comics? Isn't one significant character resurrected in this very film? Others complain about the supposed short runtime and lack of depth but X3 has the exact same runtime as the first film (104 minutes) and there's plenty of depth to mine, take Rogue's dilemma over taking a cure in order to have human intimacy, Phoenix's incredible inner conflict symbolizing the universal clash of flesh and spirit (id and super-ego), Cyclop's grief and astonishing discovery, Pyro's moral degeneration, Mystique's plight after getting kicked out of the Brotherhood and Wolverine's struggle to do the right thing despite his deep love, to name just six.

On the downside, the big clash on Alcatraz Island feels routine and dull. They should’ve kept the focus on the Dark Phoenix, but the producers probably felt this would take away from the other characters, plus they wanted the clichéd big battle sequence. Nevertheless, there’s enough good here to appreciate.

GRADE: B+"
r96sk,"I'm surprised to see a big drop in average rating for this.

I enjoyed <em>'X-Men: The Last Stand'</em> to be honest. Taking a quick look at some other reviews and it seems to main gripe is how it treats certain characters from the comics, which is fair enough for sure but that doesn't come into play for me as I'm not a comic reader.

I can only judge it as a film and as one I found it suitably entertaining. Hugh Jackman remains the top dog, though at the beginning the way Wolverine acts felt off to me - though that quickly went away. I would've liked if they found a spot for Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), though one of his replacements in Beast (Kelsey Grammer) went down well with me.

From what I read I can understand other people's complaints with this, especially with the aforementioned iffy character treatment, but I gotta be honest and say that I found it to be a good enough watch - even if it is comparatively the weakest entry of the original trilogy.

/copied directly from my Letterboxd review\"
CinemaSerf,"After a brief respite in ""X2"" (2003) we have reverted to the rather procedural and unexciting format for this third instalment of malevolent mutant-mayhem. This time ""Magneto"" (Sir Ian McKellen) is outraged when the human government develops a top secret cure for mutants. On the face of it, this is going to lead to another simple battle royal between the forces of our man-metal and his eternal nemesis ""Xavier"" (Patrick Stewart) and his army of fair-minded supporters led by ""Wolverine"" (Hugh Jackman). Thing is, though, ""Magneto"" has an ace up his sleeve in the form of the ""Dark Phoenix"" that has turned ""Jean Gray"" (Famke Janssen) into something more lethal than anyone can imagine. Can she be stopped, persuaded, destroyed? It's really a bit of same old, same old, this - great visual effects, loads of pyrotechnics and a good old dose of good versus evil, but the story is actually pretty weak and the dialogue seems to regurgitate much of that from the first film. Jackman really tries to inject a sense of thrill into this, and there's no denying that Ben Foster looks particularly hot with his angelic wings, but otherwise it might as well be another episode in a Marvel mini-series that you just know will deliver nothing more at the end than an opportunity for a sequel. It is a good looking film, but the two leads are overly hammy, and Kelsey Grammer isn't the only one to feel a bit blue at the seriously over-orchestrated denouement."
Gimly,"Monsters University, it’s great, it’s the best thing Pixar’s brought out in the past three years leading up to it. It’s enjoyable, it’s well casted and it’s cute without being too cheesy. It’s also the third miss in a row for Pixar.

MU, just like Brave (and unlike Cars 2) is filled with merit, and well worth watching. But in 1995 when Pixar came out swinging with Toy Story, people expect that sort of a trend to continue. Which it did! Right up until 2006, when they released their seventh film (Cars); the first film they’d gotten behind that didn’t blow audiences world wide out of the Goddamn water. Pixar’s limped up and down the approval ladder ever since, with MU sitting comfortably somewhere in the middle.

It is a great film. Especially for a kids’ film, especially for a prequel, all of that, but it is not the return to greatness audiences keep hoping for. It plays it safe, it lulls in the dreary, rarely well-pulled-off format of “College Comedy” (which is again, a safe area to sit in). It may not be as triumphant as the original, but it’s not all together disappointing either.
The film does what virtually any film with large amount of money behind it does: It stands in front of you for an hour and a half, does its job in the entertainment industry of “entertaining” you, then it sidles out, leaving you smiling, but not thoroughly satisfied. It takes as few risks as possible, and vehemently avoids anything new, just in case it pisses people off, and risks not making their money back.

It’s fine, people of the world are used to this, it’s a fun ride, and then it’s done. Worth your money, worth your time, but not what people have come to expect from the powerhouse of Pixar’s heyday.

r96sk,"A fun prequel to <em>'Monsters, Inc.'</em>.

It isn't on the same level as the preceding film, but <em>'Monsters University'</em> is a pleasing film nonetheless. It takes a trip backwards in time to see Mike and Sully pre-Inc. and it comes out good, it doesn't have as much as heart but the comedy is still there at a strong level.

John Goodman (Sully) and Billy Crystal (Mike) are again fantastic, while Helen Mirren comes in as a new character, Hardscrabble, and gives a pleasant performance. I don't love the other new characters, but they certainly serve a purpose and play a part.

The plot is entertaining, it drops a little bit once the competition begins but everything is still enjoyable - the 104 minute run time flies by. I think I would've preferred a sequel story featuring a grown up Boo (admittedly not sure in what way), but this production is a suitable attachment to the quality 2001 original."
John,"This is a great movie. The quality of animation is amazing, and they captured the University feel perfectly. Lots of fun little scenes, backgrounds, and homages to the original movie."
Grant English,"Is there any excuse available that will justify spending 2 hours, 45 minutes to watch this film?  Or why I am gifting it three stars?

It was a free rental at Redox.
I normally enjoy Mark Wahlberg movies.
I love Bumblebee.  

Do any of these hold water?

I know one thing that doesn’t hold a lot of water – the story. Does it really matter at this point in the franchise? There are good guy Transformers called Autobots and bad guy Transformers called Decepticons and standing between them are stupid humans that betray their species for profit – normally it’s the U.S. Government. BUT wait – there is one hero that will change all of this and talk Optimus Prime (Autobot Boss Daddy) into fighting one last battle (for the fourth or fifth time – I’ve lost count at this point) while some hot-looking woman runs around explosions in short-shorts.

You now know all you need to know about the entire _Transformer_ franchise.

For this incarnation we trade out Shia LeBeouf for Mark Wahlberg and Courtney Fox for Nicola Pelz. And now for the twist…wait for it… Mark Wahlberg plays Nicola Pelz’s FATHER.  That’s right – the FATHER. Yeah, it totally doesn’t work. At all.

There’s a point in the movie about 90 minutes in where it looks like all the loose ends are going to get tied up and I thought:  You know, that wasn’t so bad. Good action flick, a bit hoaky at points but watchable.

And then the movie keeps going. And going. For another 90 minutes. And you basically watch the movie again except instead of it being in Texas and Chicago, it’s in China and Hong Kong.

It’s too long, too many explosions, too many American flags and Texas flags in the background. This movie desperately needs an editor or it needs to be euthanized. Probably the latter.

John Goodman and Ken Watanabe lend their voices serve as decent comic relief but there’s not a lot that can save this film.  Bumblebee deserved better."
Andres Gomez,"Overdone movie for children, with tiring tricks thought for 3D but a poor animation that becomes boring for its colorfulness. If you are a kid, you may enjoy, if you are an adult, better pass ..."
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"I think I have never seen a movie with such (over)saturated and vibrant colors. Well, that is apart from the first few minutes which are in black and white as some tribute to the “original” Wizard of Oz movie. Surprisingly enough it works quite well. The sceneries and landscapes are beautiful to watch in just the right fairy-tale style that you would expect from the land of Oz.

The story is pretty much a prequel to the original Wizard of Oz story. Something which does not really intrude too much for most part of the movie but becomes painfully obvious in the last couple of scenes. As for the general story it is pretty much okay. It pleased the kids for sure and I would say that is the main goal of this movie. For adults well, as I said it is okay but not really much more.

The lead character can be infuriating at times with his “dubious ethics” as the blurb words it. Unfortunately he never really manages to convey that likable rascal attitude that one would have hoped for. He somehow just stays a rather bland character with “dubious ethics”. I think this goes for most of the other main characters as well. Except for the dubious ethics of course which for the other characters are either plain good or totally and without a doubt bad ones.

On the whole I would say that the movie was okay but never really reached any higher than that. For a kid it was probably somewhat better than okay. I did enjoy the movie although this was mostly for the unusual and vibrant colorization and the lovely scenery."
CinemaSerf,"If it were just down to the last twenty minutes or so, this might have been quite good. Sadly, though, we must watch the first hundred to get there, and they are not so good. ""Diggs"" (James Franco) is a jobbing, pretty unpleasant, magician doing the provincial shows when he and his balloon get caught up in a storm and next thing, he is in an unknown land where pretty soon he befriends a winged ape, a porcelain doll and is on the path to great riches in the ""Emerald City"". Upon arrival, acclaiming himself this great wizard, he meets three sisters who are a darned sight better with their wands - and he is soon a pawn in their game for control over ""Oz"". Can he thwart their machinations and save the city from their scheme? There is a narrative here - it's about ""Diggs"" discovering his inner decency, but it all just takes an age to get anywhere. Franco is adequate, but no better, and there three witches - Rachel Weisz, Mila Kunis and the nice one we recall from the original film ""Glinda"" (Michelle Williams) are oddly sterile with their efforts. Too much greenscreen, perhaps? Nobody seems to be at the races here. The dialogue is bland and barring a few fun expressions and observations from his put-upon sidekick ""Frank"" (Zach Braff) it just doesn't ever seem to catch fire. It does look good, the monochrome to colour effects work quite well, but otherwise I was rather underwhelmed by most of this."
Reno,"The second movie in the new Spider-man movie series that directed by Marc Webb. I doubt his potential after seeing this movie. I feel someone should take his position before it become too late. In the history of the Spider-man movies, from all the 6 this one is the worst. Commercially it has done a great business that grabbed around $800 million all over the world, but failed to deliver another quality movie for the fans. The movie engaged with the too much character and subplots. The subplots were not placed in the right spots, kind of random appearance brings the chaos in understanding the story. I had a high hope on this movie and it did not supply well. Frankly, I kind of lost interest in Spider-man. Maybe because it was too soon to reboot, I guess.

> **‘‘You want to be the hero.
> And now you gotta pay the price.’’**

The first movie gave a decent re-start for the refreshed Spider-man movie series. And what happened here in this second installment was a disaster. The first thing is it was nearly a 2 and half an hour movie that brought me lightly a headache to carry on thus far. Actually, it was 10 minutes shorter than what it is now, but in the end they have developed a bit longer to show the opening scene of the third movie. When a movie got a powerful hero, it should have equally matched antagonist. If they are matched, then the fight between them are the next thing to bring the best out of it. I think the Electro man did not click as they have expected, at least not to me. The strength he had was something beyond spider-man, but did not unleash him in a perfect manner. Though Jamie Foxx was not bad in that avatar, the filmmakers kind of wasted his presence for not so good scenes.

Remember the original Spider-man was the modern superhero movies, I mean it was done using computer graphics. Afterwards 'Batman', 'Iron Man', 'Thor' and all were followed. I like the version with Tobey Maguire in it, though my rating declined by movie after another in the trilogy. This reboot series had a good opening, but failed to get the momentum going. Especially all the emotions were looked fakes that do not appeal like the original movie series did. Yes, it had a wonderful box office and that does not mean the movie is good, either worst. But expected a little better, especially in the negative characters. Andrew Garfield was good, not awesome, because most of his masked parts were CGI. Emma stone was another let down and could not help comparing her with Kristen Dunst, because she was no way near, at all. The Dane DeHaan role had the same issue and I don't know why people did not get better space in the movie that ran 140 minutes long. Like I said subplot spoiled everything I think. The digital 3D and stunts were poor. Yeah, there are many things to complain about it than to praise, but all the answer should come in the next sequel. If that makes bigger, not commercially, I mean with a good story, graphics and performances then there will be no problem. But if it fails, I had to say 'bring back the fourth installment of the original movie series'. Definitely not worth a watch, but anyway most of the guys going to watch it or already watched it."
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"It seems that Spider Man is doomed to receive mediocre to abysmal implementations on the big screen. Well, at least in my opinion. The Amazing Spider Man 2 currently have a rating of 7.1 which quite surprises me. This was not the worst Spider Man movie. The 2nd instalment, Spider-Man 2, in the first series with Tobey Maquire still holds that title firmly.

There are some nice special effect fireworks going on and there are some funny parts when Peter Parker puts on the mask and goes to action but apart from that I found the movie uninspired, with a mediocre plot and sometimes downright boring. The plot is perhaps suitable for a comics magazine with its standard set of unlikely events, backstabbing big-corporate employees and disgruntled scientists becoming super villains but on the big-screen one would expect a wee bit more effort going into the plot.

The main villain, Electro, was … well not really giving much of an impression. He never lifted above the pretty silly scientist letting everyone walk all over him and doing really, really stupid things like trying to put two high voltage cables together without turning off the power. Sure he tried to give a menacing appearance towards the end but to me he never really managed to elevate himself to a real super-villain. I almost got the impression that the director actually realized that Electra was not good enough and so decided to come up with some convoluted scheme to throw in The Green Goblin at the end. None of these villains are really bad, just mediocre.

Then of course there is the obligatory Peter Parker wallowing in self-pity that every director seems to just have to put in these movies. It is not funny and downright boring. And for the ending cliffhanger they throw in the Rhino…as some jerk in a monster mechanical suit :-( . What the f…? The Rhino is supposed to have a polymer bonded to his skin and augmented strength and speed. Not be running around in some silly mechanical Rhino toy!

The entertainment factor of this movie comes almost entirely from the SFX action and a few select scenes. Otherwise the movie was fairly (yawn) mediocre as far as I am concerned. Having said that, being the sci-fi and super-hero fan that I am, I will probably buy the next instalment anyway if one comes out."
Andres Gomez,"The story is predictable and with zero neurons on it but Garfield and Stone connection is good and the comedy moments sort of enjoyable.

Probably you could remove the super-hero mess and you would  had a much better romantic comedy."
John Chard,"Spider-Man stuffed once again.

Marc Webb returns to direct what Sony had hoped was the second instalment of a longer running reboot of the Spider-Man franchise. Writing this now, I'm armed with the knowledge that once again the web slinger will get another reboot in 2017, which after viewing this sequel comes as no surprise.

It's not so much that it's a bad film, or a bad Spider-Man film at that, it's just that it feels all very familiar, whilst simultaneously hugging the same pitfalls as Sam Raimi's Spiderman 3. Webb tries to juggle a screenplay with 3 villains (well two and a half really), a tricky romance between Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), and of course there's school, a best friend and affairs of the home heart to deal with.

The introduction of Electro (Jamie Foxx) is a good move, inputting a new villain into the spidey world is most welcome. Yet in spite of Foxx earning some level of sympathy with the characterisation, it never really works and unfortunately draws comparisons with a certain Mr. Freeze from another franchise. Dane DeHaan comes in as Harry Osborn, soon to be Green Goblin, again the tortured soul act is well performed, but come Goblin time the make up and effects work is laughable. While Paul Giamati as Aleksei Sytsevich - cum - Rhino, is having fun but is barely in the picture.

Stone is the best thing in it by far, while Garfield works hard, but there is no getting away from the fact that they both are - and look - too old for their parts. The action is fun and pulse raising, but there's not enough of it to sustain a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes. Though on the plus side Webb and his team are to be applauded for choosing a story line that is ultimately bold and contains a great emotional whack. All told it's a shaky entry to the spidey world, one that once again forced Sony into another rethink. Lets hope the next journey spidey goes on has some clarity and streamlined sense. 6/10"
Jane Hall,Had high hopes for this one because of the first film. Was not disappointed!
CinemaSerf,"I think maybe some of the lustre from Andrew Garfield's first outing as ""Spider-Man"" had already worn off for this really rather mediocre sequel. This time he has to don his red and blue lycra and save the city - and ""Gwen"" (Emma Stone) - from the marauding ""Green Goblin"". There is quite a degree of on-screen chemistry between Garfield and Stone, and as an action-romance, this is at the more entertaining end of the scale. It's the plot and the tech elements that let it down. The visual effects upon which it relies so heavily are really nothing special. Nor, it has to be said, are the baddies. The ""Green Goblin"" just isn't menacing enough. That might be, perhaps, because Dane DeHaan is one of those actors (a bit like Michael Pitt) whom I never really understood why he made it at all. The make up artists do work wonders in demonstrating his decline into moral turpitude, but as an actor he is just, well, insipid as the poor, misguided and bitter ""Harry Osborne"". Jamie Foxx has a bit more fun as the sparky ""Electro"", though that character is largely undeveloped and Sally Field can be relied upon to add a little maternal instinct as ""Aunt May"", but somehow the whole thing is just one beat off. The first film had a much stronger story and a cast that were still bedding down; this reverses that with much more assured performances from the two at the top of the bill, but with a much less meaty story to back them up. I did like Andrew Garfield in this role - he has charisma as an actor, but this is all just a bit flat and though impressive to watch on a big screen with big sound, is not a film that will make anyone's top ten - even Marc Webb's, I think."
Matt Golden,"Where do you start with Tron: Legacy? It’s a sequel to a minor cult hit that arrived in theaters 28 years ago, a film more renown for its (at the time) state-of-the-art design than its coherent story or classic characters, rekindled now not as a reboot or remake, but as a direct sequel to that long-ago work.

Tron's esteem may have grown in the intervening years (much the same fate as another maligned-at-the-time science fiction film, Blade Runner), but time has been mostly unkind to it; Disney attempted to stage a run of pre-LEGACY screenings of the original film, but modern audiences greeted its dated appeal as unintentionally hilarious. Frightened by the impact this might have had on their $170 million spectacle, they pulled plans for a theatrical release, and whisked the recent 25th anniversary DVD off of store shelves. And so, bereft of a childhood that contained Tron, I went into the sequel with naught but a Wikipedia plot breakdown (which was, to be honest, frustratingly informative) to fill in what turned out to be largely irrelevant narrative gaps. I say that to say that I am reviewing Legacy solely for Legacy's sake, untainted by nostalgia or high expectations.

More than two decades after the events of the first film (which, for the uninitiated, involve a computer programmer [Jeff Bridges, reprising his role] being zapped from the physical world into the computer world he created and fighting an oppressive digital tyrant within), we’re introduced to that computer programmer’s twenty-something kid, heir to his father’s tech empire and not terribly happy about it. It seems he’s still hung up on his father’s mysterious disappearance long ago, and a mysterious message leads to him discovering Dear Old Dad’s secret underground lab, where he’s accidentally zapped into the digital world as well. I’m afraid I’m not spoiling anything to go ahead and say that within he finds his trapped father, and they must fight their way back out. To give more plot details would be unfair and pointless. Suffice to say that once within the digital realm, it becomes action beat after action beat wherein our young hero rescues dad and his requisite romantic interest until the film ends.

Oh sure, there are good guys, and there are bad guys, and there’s a token stab at depth, but what does it matter? That digital world looks really cool, right? And that’s why we go. The sad truth of the matter, however, is that what looks awesome in a two-minute trailer begins to wear on the eyes when presented long-form. “The Grid” exists in three colors: neon blue, neon orange, and black. Well, two colors and an absence of color, I suppose. As nifty as this may seem, two-plus hours of this (particularly at the reduced light offered by 3D projection) robs it of interest, and the whole thing becomes a dull slog. 3D works by enhancing depth, but little to no depth is present when the film is lit and shot in such a stylized manner. To boot, only the bad guys are orange. And as our audience proxy characters are good, we’re robbed even of the contrasting orange to break up the monotony.

There are some neat sequences, of course: the initial lightcycle battle, a digital dogfight later on, etc. Garret Hedlund and Oliva Wilde are perfectly fine in their frankly bland roles, and Jeff Bridges squeezes what depth he can into his dual characters (actual Kevin Flynn and his twenty-years-younger digital duplicate, thanks to some unnerving but nifty visual trickery). The film is far from the unwatchable dreck of, say, The Chronicles of Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader. It’s just...not very interesting. Techno group Daft Punk’s score was easily the best part of the film, and something I’d actually recommend picking up with no hesitations. At its best, the Daft Punk score and stylized imagery (early in the film, before it wears you down) do provide a unique and imaginative experience. It’s just one fit for the length of a music video, not a feature film.

But let’s not kid ourselves: Tron: Legacy is a flashy, ridiculous spectacle that exists solely to put pretty pictures onscreen for two hours and drive a $4+ 3D surcharge. And I say that with no judgment. Some films simply are what they are, and you’ve no more right to expect a dog to meow than to glean from them deep meditations on the human condition. The history of cinema is full of this kind of shallow but aloofly entertaining distraction. But is it wrong to want more of these kinds of films? Take Star Wars, for instance: its strength lies mainly in its revolutionary aesthetic and special effects, but it’s the characters that we remember from the film, not just how cool some set-piece looked. And Lucas isn’t even a terribly good writer; the strength of his characters came from that universal pull all great archetypes have, that ability for audience identification and empathy. Will the name Sam Flynn have the same kind of longevity? What about...uh, Oliva Wilde’s character? Apparently not, at least for me. (Note: IMDb says it’s “Quorra.”) If nostalgia for the first film is strong for you, or you’ve no qualms about paying $14+ for a mildly-distracting if uninvolving experience, go for it. Everyone else may as well save themselves the money. Maybe catch it on Blu-ray.

I should note, though, that I can honestly say 3D added nothing to the experience, so if you want to be able to actually see in The Grid, save yourself the money and hop into a 2D seat."
r96sk,"A massive upgrade on the first film, at least for someone like me who certainly doesn't enjoy the 1982 production.

<em>'TRON: Legacy'</em> is much more vibrant, developed and tangible. I actually formed a connection with the characters in this one, which is the complete opposite to the original. The special effects (bar the de-aging) are a vast improvement, which is to be expected in fairness; I love the look of this.

It's nice to get a proper view into the 'outside' lives of the protagonists, rather than receiving a tiny backstory before shoving them into the new universe; I appreciated the build-up to the eventual entry. The score is also terrific, even if it's strange hearing Daft Punk's ""Outlands"" due to my familiarity of it coming from Sky Sports UK's Formula 1 opening credits.

Garrett Hedlund is great in the role Sam, I enjoyed his performance from the get-go. Jeff Bridges is excellent too, I feel all the actors in general were given much more to work with in this one; I barely took notice of Bridges (& Co.) in the predecessor, but he stands out big here. Olivia Wilde and Michael Sheen are good, also. Cillian Murphy even makes a minute appearance.

It does, at least to me, feel like a very different film when compared to <em>'Tron'</em>, which may disappoint lovers of the latter but will be relief to opposing folk; e.g. me.

Wasn't sure what to expect from this, but thankfully it produces an entertaining time."
mooney240,"**Overall : Kosinski upgrades TRON in every way for a new generation with this stunning sci-fi adventure.**

Believe it or not, Top Gun was not the first franchise Joseph Kosinski revives with a legacy sequel over 30 years after the original. And just like Top Gun: Maverick, Kosinski did a masterful job bringing a series back to life. TRON: Legacy improved on its predecessor in every way. I remember seeing it in 3D IMAX and being completely blown away at the effects (although the de-aging effects are pretty dated but were impressive at the time), the soundtrack, the story, and the acting. Kosinski connected the past with the modern age by bringing back Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner while providing a story that engages and intrigues a new generation. I can't say I was a major fan of the original, but I loved this movie. This sci-fi adventure felt like the beginning of something incredible, but sadly Disney acquired Marvel shortly after the release of TRON: Legacy and shifted their focus to the MCU. Hopefully, after Kosinski's success with Top Gun: Maverick, the chances of a TRON 3 will be reignited because I am ready for more!"
Filipe Manuel Dias Neto,"**Lots of style, lots of high-quality visuals, but little substance.**

There are things that are inexplicable, and one of them is how “Tron” managed to become popular, even after not being a big hit in its time. I have already written about it and I stand by what I said: it is a film that I understand, that came in the wake of a popular fever around everything electronic, but that was made before its time, with visual and special effects that, today, seem as archaic as a 1990s cell phone. I don't know if this movie should be a sequel or if it should have been made a remake instead, but there's no doubt about the superiority of this movie: not only does it feature visual effects and CGI of great beauty and quality, as it has a frankly better script (which does not mean perfection).

Indeed, the script is satisfactory, presenting an unlikely story, where a very rich young man decides to sabotage his own company thinking he is doing what his father, who disappeared for years, would approve. After that, he receives a message from his father, and the clue leads him to an old arcade, long closed, and to his father's old computer. It is there that the young man is sucked into a cybernetic space, controlled by a vile and dictatorial program. Yes, humans sucked, physically speaking, into computers. As if social media weren't enough! Added to this, the worn-out clichés of the relationship between an absent father and a needy son, an essay on a loving sub-plot without any logic, a cartoon villain without personality and made to hate.

Jeff Bridges returns to the character he played in the first film, both in the person of the actor we know, and in the figure of a young alter-ego, created digitally. The actor is good, and we already know his merits, but the truth is that he doesn't seem to be in great shape. He accompanies the film, following the action, but he is not particularly noticeable in this work, as he was not in the initial film. Garrett Hedlund has a little more visibility and is, in fact, the protagonist here, but he doesn't do much more than be an action figure.

It is in the technical aspects that the film stands out and deserves some praise, particularly thanks to the extraordinary design of the visual effects and the CGI, which are among the most elegant and well-executed we have seen. Recreating the concepts of the original film, they show a cleaner and more finished look, without obvious gimmicks that are unbelievable to the eyes, and with much better worked colors. However, a film is not made of style and extraordinary visuals, and there are many recent examples of visually amazing films that are worthless because they do not have quality stories. Also noteworthy are the sets and costumes, as well as the electronic soundtrack, by the French dJ duo Daft Punk."
Andres Gomez,"Lasseter is smart enough to tell us a completely different story than in the first movie. However, it is far from other titles like ""Toy Story"" or ""The Incredibles""."
r96sk,"I like <em>'Cars 2'</em>.

It doesn't deserve to be held in the same bracket as 2006's <em>'Cars'</em>, but that doesn't mean there's not a good time to be had with it. The premise mixes motorsport with espionage, admittedly they don't execute it incredibly but it's still satisfactory to see unfold.

One slight negative is that they give Mater more screen time than Lightning McQueen, which is a mistake. Larry the Cable Guy as Mater is enjoyable, just not front and center as the lead. They could've done a similar plot that has Owen Wilson and McQueen at the forefront. Elsewhere, Michael Caine (Finn) is always a joy to listen to; even if his character isn't anything special.

The racing stuff is cool, with the World Grand Prix. The parts of the story involving strictly that are definitely more entertaining than the spy stuff, especially as we get to see a few different countries via animation - which come out nicely.

All in all, a weaker film than the first for sure but it's still pretty solid for a Disney animated sequel."
John Chard,"Lean, Green, Pudding Machine.

Green Lantern does an efficient job for someone like me who was after a colourful bit of noisy entertainment. No expectation levels are set other than to not be insulted, so by and large this does a job. This falls more in line with a comic book adaptation that has no desire to set up a broody and conflicted hero, no hidden agendas or metaphors in the villain ranks, so yes! It's got a little campy flavouring to it. Which is fine if that is what you ordered.

The effects work is very effective, though the sequences involving one of the villains, Parallax, are hindered by it being quite simply a very silly looking being. The story has some credible complexities about it, but the writers strain to keep it simple enough for a younger audience - which is both a blessing and a curse since it becomes uneven and corny whilst still retaining a watchable fun factor. The acting is only fine, but again this is because the script is never sure when to give emotional heft to the characters, or when to add some dramatic vulnerability.

It's a safe superhero film, a creamy desert to satisfy the sweet palate, maybe one that is flavoured with Chartreuse? In other words it fills a gap for a while and is then quickly vanished from the memory. 6/10

Footnote: extended cut recommended as a preference since it puts more flesh on the human bones."
zenorking,Great for the kids!
ohlalipop,"Just like any other Pixar movies, Toy Story 3 was great. The story flowed really well with the two Toy Story movies. And just like the two other movies, it was funny, has a lot of action and adventure, and it was really touching.


I guess at some point, everyone was able to relate to the story. That's why it's so great. It's great for young children and really great for adults. It's a good ending for the Toy Story movies. 


My rate for this movie is A."
Gimly,"When I first watched this nearly a decade ago in the cinema, I believe it was (and still is) the only movie I've ever watched in 3D that I've enjoyed. I was worried that it was that great theatrical experience I'd had that coloured my opinion of _Toy Story 3_ so positively, and that it wouldn't hold up to any further scutiny. But I gotta say, on re-watch? It **absolutely** holds up. In my opinion, **strong** contender for best work Pixar's ever put out. 

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._"
JPV852,"Just an all around wonderful and poignant sequel that surpasses the others. Great seeing the gang working together and the voice casting was, once again, perfect. While Toy Story 4 was good, this served as a great finale. **5.0/5**"
r96sk,"I don't love <em>'Toy Story 3'</em> as much as its two predecessors. That doesn't mean that it isn't anything other than great though.

I enjoy the bountiful humour and intriguing plot, while the newly-introduced toys are very good. If I had to nitpick, I don't massively like Lotso, who kinda feels to me like a slight copy of The Prospector from the 1999 sequel - with the difference here being he's the ultimate antagonist, perhaps too villainous for my own personal taste. As I said though, just a tiny criticism in the grand scheme of these productions.

Tom Hanks remains on top form as Woody, as do all the others including Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and Jessie (Joan Cusack). Ned Beatty does a terrific job as Lotso, while Barbie and Ken are brought to life well by Jodi Benson and Michael Keaton.

Once again there are some excellent scenes, with the ending also being entertaining just like in <em>'Toy Story 2'</em>. There's also a lot of heart in the concluding scene. I'm surprised they did a fourth time, even if I do agree it's still a very good new instalment.

Pixar and Disney keep up a pretty remarkable high quality, even in the third film of the franchise. I will never tire watching these."
CinemaSerf,"Though ""Andy"" hasn't played with his toys in many a year, he still can't bear to be parted with them as he heads to college, so he puts them in a bin bag destined for the attic. Unfortunately, mom mistakes it for unwanted stuff and outside they go. ""Woody"" was alone in being kept safe, and as he espies the bin lorry approaching, he has to dash to rescue his friends - only for them to end up in a day-care centre (""Sunnyside"") where the other toys don't always play fair. The plot develops pretty much as expected as ""Woody"" tries to organise a rescue from the outside whilst the imprisoned toys try to make their own way back home. Never before have I considered that ""Ken"" (yep, Mr ""Barbie"") could be remotely menacing, nor that a pink teddy bear called ""Lotso' could have a dominant streak a mile wide. Add to the mix, a recently reset ""Buzz"" who has forgotten just about everything and is now an enforcer, and this makes their break for freedom even harder. The script is quickly paced and witty, especially as the ""prison"" regime kicks in and the ""box"" becomes something akin to the ""cooler"" in a war film. This story deals a little more seriously with emotions of love and rejection but always in an humorous and engaging fashion - there is still plenty of fun and mischief to be had. I think this might be my favourite so far..."
Anton2k,"What can I say about this movie, its amazing! full of explosions and action. The setting is slightly different than other terminator films but I like this new ""survival"" setting more so than the older terminators. Terminator 2 was and always will be my favourite terminator movie but this one sure comes close, defiantly my second favourite terminator movie.

There is only so much a review can tell you but this is a must watch movie for any one who has not seen it yet."
Mas Manado,worst of the terminator series
Jodie,"What can I say about Terminator Salvation? It's a decent addition to the Terminator series, but has major issues. Some would say that it is the worst of the series, but I disagree. T3 will always hold that top honor for me. 

It was nice to see the return of Kyle Reeese. It was a different look at a character that was forgotten to quickly. John Connor was a bit stale and I wanted way from his character. 

It was nice to see this future everyone spoke about in past films, Problem was this film felt darker than all the others, excluding T1. The first film was pretty dark but had a storyline And an R Rating to back that up. This film just didn't feel like it belonged to the Terminator world. And a few nostalgic lines and visuals did nothing to make it feel like it was part of the franchise. 

All of that being said, the film still had some decent action scenes and some interesting moments. It's not bad, but its not fantastic either."
Gimly,"I know that even amongst the rocky track record of the _Terminator_franchise, _Terminator Salvation_ is not especially well-liked. I've always been a little bit of an outlier when it came to this series though; like everyone else, I know the first two are the only great ones, but to me, it's actually not _T2_ that stands at the top of the pile, but _The Terminator_, the first film. And since that first film, we've copped 5 new runs at a _Terminator_ movie. Out of all 5 of them, _Salvation_ is the only one that tried something different from the first one. Even the lofty success of _T2_ was garnered using the same core concept as the original movie. _Salvation_ hits something new, and while that obviously doesn't work for a lot of its audience, for me, it's the best movie outside of the first two that the franchise has made to date.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
Wuchak,"_**Wall-to-wall post-apocalyptic action needed more time to breathe**_

The first couple of Terminator films are easily two of the greatest sci-fi/action flicks in history. The problem with the third one, more than anything else, was that it was largely just more of the same; and you can only recycle the same plot so many times before it gets stale. This explains the filmmakers’ decision to set this fourth installment (2009) in the post-apocalyptic future where the machine-controlled Skynet is at war with the surviving humans, otherwise known as The Resistance.

A few characters from the previous films are featured: An older John Conner (Christian Bale), his dad Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), who's actually just a teenager here (such are the complexities of time travel) and the T-800 Schwarzenegger Terminator (CGI face, of course). Beyond these we get some new characters, the best being Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), followed by Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood). Also on hand are: Conner's mate, Kate (Bryce Dallas Howard), a mute girl named Star and Helena Bonham Carter in a peripheral role.

On the surface everything is of the highest filmmaking caliber. The problem is that there's not enough character development or intriguing respites. So what we end up with is a plot that strings together a bunch of cool post-apocalyptic action sequences with people who are constantly grim, shouting and killing, but we barely know them and therefore hardly care. It's like putting on an extreme metal cd that's full of hyper drumming, buzzsaw riffing & screeching/grunting vocals from beginning to end. There are no valleys to contrast the over-the-top highs and so it cops a samey-sounding, dull vibe. In other words, the very energy and excitement meant to impress & move the consumer backfires due to overkill. That's why they call it ""overKILL."" It's a curious thing but all too true.

Be that as it may, there are enough positive elements in “Terminator Salvation” to make it worth checking out if you’ve seen the first two films. For instance, Marcus Wright is an intriguing protagonist who thinks there's no good in him until he is informed otherwise. At around the 45-minute mark there's a good campfire scene in the desert between two characters sharing a warm moment in a world gone mad. The film would have been more effective if it contained more scenes like this. But there's a decent revelation in the second hour concerning one of the main characters. Meanwhile Bryce Dallas Howard has a uniquely beautiful face (although she’s pregnant throughout the story). There are also some interesting ruminations about the nature of being a human and being a machine, or both.

Bottom line, if you love action, you'll get it here. There are motorcycle-bots, fish-bots, giant-bots, flying-bots and Schwarzenegger-bots, all trying to terminate the protagonists. Since the events take place in a post-apocalyptic world it’s reminiscent of films like “Beneath the Planet of the Apes” (1970), “Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome” (1985) and, especially, “Reign of Fire” (2002), albeit with constant outrageous thrills.

The first two films in the series successfully captivate the viewer from the get-go and the suspense builds to avalanche proportions. Even the third installment accomplished this to a lesser degree, although the plot was old-hat by that point (2003); still, it was a decent entry. ""Terminator Salvation,"" on the other hand, only captivates marginally in preference for wall-to-wall action. That's too bad, but it has its moments; it's thankfully not as bad as ""The Mummy Returns"" (2001) in this regard. Not to mention it'll likely play better on repeat viewings in light of the convoluted plot.

The theatrical release runs 115 minutes and the director's cut 118 minutes. The film was shot in New Mexico.

Here's how I grade each of the Terminator outings (I have yet to see the sixth one):

T1: A+

T2: A+

T3: B+

T4: B-

T5: C+"
Kenechukwu,"Revenge is so so cold...... action packed, thrilling and suspense filled but still some bits of make believe tricks here and there. 
How did Hobbs know that there's a need for the drone to be brought down right after leaving the hospital bed? how did he know where the drone was at the moment when he left with the ambulance? How did Deckard Shaw know both that Toretto and his crew will be both on the route of Afghanistan and also when they were at Abu Dhabi? 
Its a little bit odd and out of place for the director and script editor.... 
As for the next upcoming part in the franchise, i think Mark Wahlberg should be considered for a part in the rest of Fast and furious franchise..... Cheers ! ! !"
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"This is one of those movies where the French decided on an English name but for some inexplicable reason the original English name was not good enough for them. So in France it is called Fast & Furious 7 but I believe it is called Furious Seven in the US. Typical French way of doing things I am afraid.

This movie is probably not for everyone. It is very typical for the latest Fast & Furious movies though. The movie can be summed up by explosions, fast cars, fighting, did I mention explosions, repeat until credits roll. For me it was just what I expected and just what I wanted from this particular movie as well. If you are into fast cars, lots of action and explosive special effects and a bit of male macho talk then this movie will please you just fine.

The gang is back. I have to confess that I like both Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson even though they are rather far from Shakespeare material as far as acting goes. For this kind of movie they are perfect though. Unfortunately Dwayne Johnson was absent for a good chunk of the movie. When he came back from his brief presence in the beginning of the movie he did so with a vengeance though. I was actually expecting to dislike “Mr Nobody” but I have to say that I quite liked him.

Despite the fact that this is a macho action movie there is at least a small kernel of story in there. It is a classical revenge story but it is embellished with enough material to make it fairly decent. Well, decent within the confines of this kind of movie of course. Seen from a reasonable point of view the entire movie is of course totally ludicrous. The stunts are really cool but if you sober up from the adrenaline feast you rather quickly find a lot of the stunts pretty far out. Like jumping between buildings in fancy cars and such like. Even if we skip the most ridiculous scenes there are plenty more to nit-pick about. Like the fact that those old, but cool, American cars that Torretto drives would not have a chance in hell against his more modern adversaries unless possibly if the road was entirely straight. But then, these ridiculous things are what the fast and furious series is all about is it not?

Well, after about two hours of ludicrous, but very entertaining, actions stunts there is a happy ending and when the credits roll this viewer is definitely a happy customer."
Dan_Tebasco,"**Put's the Zzz in Zombie**

First time I saw it 3 odd years ago I was not impressed.

Decided to give it another go though today, which I wish I hadn't cause it was even worse and more dull than I remember.

Now when I say dull I don't necessarily mean that it lacks action (it has a bunch of scenes with action, and being that these zombies run superfast unlike the typical zombies in film and series perhaps even a bit more than the average) but lack of interesting characters or good actors and any sort of originality in script makes it a tired ride.

Brad Pitt is not necessarily a great actor but he seriously did his most barebones performance here, you were just on the run from zombies with cars flying over and all kinds of stuff but you barely show any sort of emotion? Borderline Steven Segal territory ocassionally, or at the very least Jean Claude Van Damme... But without the fighting skills.

So yeah not an impressive film."
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"As with most zombie movies the plot is rather contrived and unbelievable (even if you accept the existence of zombies) but if you want to watch zombie movies in the first place that is something that you are supposed to be immune to.

This is another variant of zombies being created by some virus and rapidly taking over most of the planet. As I said, the entire story is somewhat unbelievable. When I first read about zombies as a kid there was always some supernatural/magic stuff involved. I think I liked that “explanation” much better than the virus nonsense which just have too many holes in it. For example there is no way a virus could make human bodies roam around aimlessly inside a sterile laboratory for days without nutrition. Well, as I said, it is a zombie movie so one just have to get over these little issues.

As an action movie with zombies as the main adversary it is a fairly good movie. The action is solid, the special effects okay and the entire movie continues at a reasonably brisk pace. Pitt is also doing a decent job of his role. There are few of the other actors that are very memorable though. The scenes where the zombies pile onto each other to scale walls and even reach choppers are rather cool. The movie is not very gory for being a zombie movie. Whether that is a good thing or not depends on the viewer I guess. Personally I do not mind some gory stuff in zombie movies.

There are a few annoying parts which Hollywood always seem to have to throw in. For example, the world is on the brink of the apocalypse and Lane and his wife just doesn’t want to get involved. What the f…? Also why do people always let their kids wander away in situations where they really should keep track of them? Not to mention how clumsy people always get when they have to sneak around and be silent. These things are just annoying.

Anyway, this movie fulfils its purpose as two hours of action-filled but not too intelligent entertainment quite well."
mooney240,"**World War Z makes the zombie hordes even more terrifying in their relentless need to consume, coupled with their fury, speed, and inevitability. No zombie movie comes close to the horror and intensity of World War Z.**

JayDeeMac,"**Year of release** 2014 **Directed by** Bryan Singer **Written by** Simon Kinberg **Starring** Hugh Jackman James McAvoy Michael Fassbender Jennifer Lawrence Peter Dinklage Ellen Page

**X-Men: Days of Future Past** (rating: 4 ++)

**Plot** - In a dystopian future of 2023 where mutant-kind has been all but wiped out by powerful robots known as Sentinels the last surviving mutants launch one final attempt to save their species from extinction. Hiding out in a monastery in China, Kitty Pryde (Page) sends Wolverine's (Jackman) consciousness back in time to 1973. His task is to prevent Mystique (Lawrence) from murdering the Sentinels' creator Bolivar Trask (Dinklage). His murder made him a martyr and ensured that his destructive creation went into production. In addition, Mystique is captured in the process and her DNA used to engineer even more powerful machines. By stopping the murder the hope is that they will change the future and save their species. Seeking out the young Charles Xavier (McAvoy) Wolverine is despondent to find that he is not the man he will come to know decades later. With Xavier a broken man, Wolverine's first challenge is to help him find his old strength. The next challenge isn't one that sits all that well with Xavier; they must break Magneto (Fassbender) out of a prison cell beneath the Pentagon. To do so they enlist the aid of Quicksilver (Evan Peters), a mutant with superhuman speed. With Magneto and Xavier once again standing side-by-side they head to Paris to attempt to stop Trask's murder at Mystique's hands, but will they make it in time?

In a fitting move considering the storyline of this film allow me to go back in time to the year 2000 where I can still remember going to see the first X-Men film in August of that year. Hard as it may be to believe, the big superhero film was not the guaranteed box office success they are nowadays. Following the disastrous reception that met 1997's Batman & Robin the superhero genre was on life support, and another big failure could have seen the plug pulled. Thankfully for all us fanboys out there the film proved to be both a critical and commercial success, kicking off a surge in comic book films which has seen them come to dominate the box-office. Well somehow 14 years have passed since then (and I can't quite believe that :eek:) and we now have the 7th film in the X-Men franchise. Now since the solid start of X-Men the series hasn't exactly been the most reliable in terms of quality and has been rather overshadowed by the Batman's, Spider-Man's, Iron Man's and Avengers' of this world. In truth you could probably split the previous 6 films evenly into 'the good' and 'the not so good'; though to be fair to The Wolverine which I'd put in the latter category it's pretty decent. Well as the 7th film in the series this was always set to break the tie and the good news is that it has swung the pendulum very much towards the positive side of things. 

That said however I didn't find that I was quite as high on the film as many other people seem to be. As seems to be the case for just about every other superhero film these days, the release of DoFP has seen many people instantly jump on the bandwagon of proclaiming this the best superhero film ever. While I certainly wouldn't go that far this is an extremely entertaining entry into the X-Men franchise, and one that continues the upswing of First Class. The film does open in absolutely thrilling fashion and ends quite strongly as well. In between these wonderful bursts of action though I just found that the film had a tendency to fall into a lull on a couple of occasions. With its complicated story the film has to spend a lot of time trying to keep things clear for the audience, which sadly results in the situation and the stakes being reiterated time and time again. It just threatens to get bogged down by becoming overly talky, derailing the momentum and in general I didn't feel it was as well paced as Captain America: The Winter Soldier for example. An additional action sequence or two I don't think would have gone amiss. I also feel that it perhaps lacked the colour, energy and sense of fun of X-Men: First Class. Some of that comes from the fact that I didn't feel DoFP embraced its period setting to the degree that First Class did which on more than one occasion felt like a Sean Connery Bond film. A few snazzy outfits and some brief touches upon the Vietnam War aside I don't think it really exploited the 70s era to the fullest. And I think the Vietnam sequence was actually amongst the film's weaker moments; an unnecessary detour which could easily have been left on cutting room floor.  

As I mentioned, the opening sequence of DoFP is a terrific way to kick the film off; in fact I think its got to be one of the best opening gambits of any superhero film. The film instantly drops us right into the middle of a Sentinel attack upon the X-Men in the future; making for an absolutely thrilling opening. It's a wonderfully creative sequence that features  some genius choreography as the hitherto unknown Blink (played by Fan Bingbing), with her ability to create teleportation portals, emerges as one of the most visually dazzling mutants we've seen so far throughout the series. It's a terrific set-piece that the film arguably never matches for the next two hours, at least in terms of action and excitement; there is a sequence however that is fantastically entertaining which we'll get to later. The big finale then aims to be and mostly achieves feeling like a suitably epic affair that encapsulates Sentinels, the White House and the RFK sports stadium. At the same time the film is also jumping back and forth between this and the future where the Sentinels have once again launched an assault upon the X-Men. The only problem, and one that is in complete contrast to other superhero films such as Man of Steel, is that I didn't feel its concluding battle was quite long enough. The two competing sequences feel like they are slightly lacking in action and drama, and are over too soon.

**Film Trivia Snippets** - In reference to the X-Men member Kitty Pryde, and her importance to this particular film, DoFP was shot under the working title of “Hello Kitty.” /// Days of Future Past is based on a storyline of the same name that appeared across two issues of Uncanny X-Men in 1981, and was written by Chris Claremont. It is now the fourth film to be based on a story penned by legendary X-Men writer Claremont. X2 was adapted from 'God Loves, Man Kills'; X-Men: The Last Stand was based on his 'Dark Phoenix Saga'; and The Wolverine was based on his comic of the same name. In the comic the future world was set in the year 2013, the same year in which filming for the movie version began. /// The bullet wounds that appear on Wolverine's chest on his arrival to the 1970s is in the form of the Big Dipper. This is an homage to the 1980s anime series, Fist of the North Star, whose protagonist Kenshiro has the same scar pattern on his chest. /// Prior to making the film, Bryan Singer had a two-hour discussion with James Cameron abut how to make a time-travel concept feasible and workable within the film. Thanks to Cameron's experience as the director of The Terminator and Terminator 2 the two discussed concepts including alternate universes and string theory (a field of quantum physics that define multiple universes). /// It's quite clear just by looking at the credits that this is one hell of a cast that's been assembled. If you're looking for more proof however then how about this; the four main female X-Men in the principal cast (Halle Berry, Jennifer Lawrence, Ellen Page and Anna Paquin) are all Academy Award nominess, while the six principle male cast members (Hugh Jackman, Michael Fassbender, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart and Peter Dinklage) are all Golden Globe nominees.

With such a prestigious cast at Bryan Singer's disposal it's no surprise to find that performances across the board are generally of a high standard. Though the sizeable cast means that not everyone gets an equal chance to shine; Halle Berry's involvement for example is little more than a cameo. In fact I'm struggling to think if she even had a single line throughout the whole film or if all she did was make it rain a little bit. And the whole future ensemble are almost completely sidelined, meaning that the established regulars are given little to do other than spout some exposition, while the various new additions (Bishop, Blink, Warpath, Sunspot etc) are given absolutely no introduction whatsoever so we have little reason to care about them or mourn their demise. In fact for the majority of them I'm not even sure there names are known until we get to the closing credits. The lack of exposure given to the future timeline was certainly a disappointment. As a result it's in the past where the most noteable performances come from with solid efforts coming from Lawrence, Fassbender, Jackman etc. However the one individual who is able to stand out from the crowd for me would have to be James McAvoy who I thought was just excellent as the young Charles Xavier. The fact that he is given the strongest characterisation and the most to work with certainly helps. We initially find him as this supremely broken individual who is in great pain both physically and emotionally, but with help from Wolverine he is able to find his way back onto his path. 		

The two most notable additions to the X-Men world this time out were Evan Peters' Quicksilver and Peter Dinklage's Bolivar Trask. And as it turns out the end result for both was completely flipped from what many were predicting beforehand. The promo images for Quicksilver had fanboys already sharpening their knives before the film had even hit cinemas, ready to tear into him with the kind of fervour reserved for Batsuit nipples and Ben Affleck. And yes I have to say that his appearance still comes across as rather bizarre and stupid, kind of like Julian Assange as styled by Lady Gaga. As a character however he kind of kicks ass, his introduction arguably being the coolest addition to the franchise since Alan Cumming's Nightcrawler back in X2. And just like Nightcrawler had with his incursion into the White House, Quicksilver is given the spotlight all to himself at one point to really make a name for himself. This time it's a break-out from the Pentagon where his incredible speed comes into its own with a terrifically fun and inventive set-piece that allows him to steal the film from his more illustrious co-stars before sadly disappearing shortly afterwards. The way he is just written out is rather disappointing and feels like it's only been done to help free up space for everyone else. It does however leave the audience wanting more, so it's good news that he's going to be starring in X-Men: Apocalypse. My only concern about the character is whether they've actually made him too powerful. They show his abilities as being so strong that you imagine he could destroy any mutants, even the likes of Magneto and Xavier, before they even had the chance to respond.

The real disappointment amongst the cast is Dinklage's Trask. Now Dinklage is a great actor, no doubt about that, and I think he personally does good work here. It's just that the character he is lumbered with here I felt was a little bit dull to be honest (particularly for the film's supposed 'big bad'), giving him very little to really sink his teeth into. That also creates one of the film's few main flaws in my eyes; the lack of a strong villain. Trask kind of takes the place of Senator Kelly from the first X-Men film, but that film also had Magneto and his Brotherhood of Mutants as villains. While the future X-Men do face off against the considerable threat of the Sentinels they are a fairly blank entity devoid of an actual character or personality that can interact with the X-Men. Which is not to say they are not effective foils for our mutant heroes, you just get the feeling that there should be big bad in charge of deploying and controlling those machines. In terms of design the Sentinels may disappoint and likely anger the real X-Men fanboys out there, baring little resemblance to their comic book counterparts. In fact they aren't a million miles away from The Destroyer as seen in the first Thor film. However I don't think there's any denying that they most certainly do make an impact; in fact they are rather chilling, unsettling creations. The fact that the X-Men suffer some very violent, nasty deaths certainly heightens that feeling.	

**Film Trivia Snippets** - Bryan Singer talked about ""changing history"" in an interview with Empire Magazine(May 2014). The director stated ""I don't want people to panic about us erasing the movies. I believe in multiverses,"" explaining the possibility of certain events as they would be part of the history of alternate universes. /// In the ""Days of Future Past"" comic it was Shadowcat (Kitty Pryde) who went back in time; in the film it's Wolverine. According to writer Simon Kinberg, Kitty was intended to be the time-traveller but it didn't work out: ""Kitty in the era of young Magneto and Xavier, would have been negative 20 years old. The reflex response to that was a character who doesn't age. Wolverine is the only character who would look the same in 1973 as he does in the future."" Thus, Wolverine was picked for being an ageless immortal character who would bridge past and future. /// To create the sensation of Quicksilver's incredible speed ability Bryan Singer filmed his scenes in a special format of 3600 frames per second. This means that Quicksilver will be moving 150 times faster than normal. /// Josh Helman was originally going to be cast as a young Cain Marko/Juggernaut. But Juggernaut was written out of the film, and Helman was offered the role of a young William Styker. /// Bryan Singer based Bolivar Trask on Adolg Hitler; “As Hitler used the Jews as a scapegoat to bond the darker parts of Europe, he's doing the same thing with mutants. But he wasn't a six foot, perfect blond Aryan - he was a short, funny looking fellow!” 		

Now considering the fairly dense and complicated storyline that encompasses two timelines and what feels like dozens of characters I think that the film's writer, Simon Kinberg, actually does a fairly commendable job of keeping everything in some kind of balance and managing to just about ensure that it all makes some kind of sense. And considering the twisted mess of continuity that he has had to deal with it would perhaps be unfair to poke holes at it. But hey these are films for comic book fanboys, what do you expect but for us to nitpick! :D The film is still unable to address a few niggling questions, perhaps because that continuity mess makes it almost impossible to actually do so. However questions still linger such as how exactly is Charles Xavier still alive after being killed off in X-Men: The Last Stand? What's the deal with Wolverine's claws and their constant shifting back and forth between adamantium and bone? Still no explanation as to why Xavier and Mystique didn't appear to know each other in the original trilogy, but were so incredibly close according to these films etc. The script has to spend so much time just trying to establish the story that there is little chance to focus on the actual characters at its heart. As someone who loved the Magneto-Xavier relationship and interaction in First Class that's a shame. And it feels like there is barely a single line of dialogue in the whole film that isn't exposition	

The script also fails to address a few new issues, just completely glossing over them perhaps in the hopes that we just won't notice. For example when and how exactly did Ellen Page's Kitty Pryde get the ability to send people's consciousness through time? And perhaps it's just me but the whole plot point (and it's a very important one) about Mystique's blood being so vital in the development of the Sentinels seems rather vague and questionable in its logic. If they were going to go down that route I feel Rogue would have been a somewhat more logical choice given that her ability is to replicate the powers of other mutants, not just change her physical appearance. It kind of came across as them just trying to shoehorn Mystique into being as important as possible to the film, largely inspired you suspect by the meteoric rise of Jennifer Lawrence since First Class. In fact with Hugh Jackman getting on in years, and his days as Wolverine coming to an end, the search is on to perhaps try and find the new face of the franchise. With Channing Tatum set to take on the character of Gambit he seems like a decent bet to take over that mantle. However with Days of Future Past they certainly seem to be positioning Jennifer Lawrence as another possibility to take on the role if she were to extend her current deal. I doubt anyone would ever have predicted Mystique being pushed to the fore in such fashion. Oh and just as another little nit-pick; was I the only one who thought the make-up job for Mystique looked rather s*itty this time out? I think it looks a lot more fake now than it ever did even 14 years ago.			

Just a few more thoughts to wrap up. After the fresh start that was First Class, bringing Wolverine back and once again making him a central figure feels like a little bit of a step back. While he's only had two official solo films this almost films like the 6th Wolverine-focused film we've now had in the series. And if you're going to bring him back I think you should at least use him correctly. His strongest feature for me is as a brutal, kick-ass warrior, but DoFP actually gives him surprisingly little opportunity to unsheathe those iconic claws of his, placing him more in the role of a diplomat trying to keep the peace between Magneto and Xavier. The fact that the film kills so many of the mutants introduced in First Class offscreen I found quite disappointing. And the use of Blink's portals aside I didn't think the film quite captured the same team dynamic that was present in First Class, with several of the team going off on solo missions or taking their enemies out all by themselves. And now a couple of other little things that I liked. While we get to see very little of it the wasteland that the Earth has become in the future dystopia is a very effective and stirring touch, and one that evokes the future war as seen in the Terminator films. Oh and one little touch that I really loved was the film recreating newreel footage of the decade to match actual footage from the era. It comes off looking like the Zapruder JFK film. 

Amongst fans of superhero films, 2008 is seen as a bit of a holy grail for the genre; the release of both The Dark Knight and Iron Man, two of the most acclaimed and loved entries so far, gaining it that reputation. 2014 has so far seen the release of two great efforts (The Winter Soldier and Days of Future Past); if Guardians of the Galaxy lives up to the promise of its trailers then we could have a new contender for that title of comic book movie's holy grail year. 

**Conclusion** - I know I've been pointing out a lot of flaws with the film in this review (perhaps as a response to all the gushing over it) but the truth is I did still find it to be an extremely entertaining addition to the X-Men series. As a result of some of those flaws however I'm not quite as high on it as many other people seem to be. For the moment I would have it in 2nd place amongst 2014's superhero flicks behind the excellent Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and after one viewing it would slot into 3rd place amongst the X-Men films.	

One thing I should definitely add however is my condition when watching it. As I have been for a great deal of time recently I wasn't feeling particularly great when I went to watch it; feeling rather run-down and a bit yuck. So that perhaps hindered my enjoyment slightly,meaning there's a chance that score could rise on a repeat viewing.			



**Bonus Film Trivia** -  Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen were performing in a touring production of ""Waiting for Godot"" when Bryan Singer approached the actors about reprising their respective roles as Professor X and Magneto. According to McKellen, both men were utterly shocked as they thought they'd passed their roles on to James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, and would never play the characters again. Both Stewart and McKellen were delighted to return to two of their most popular roles, and to work with the younger actors playing the same characters as well. /// When Matthew Vaughn was going to direct, he was going to make the film a direct sequel to X-Men First Class and have it set in the 1970s. Early ideas included an opening with the Kennedy assassination being caused by Magneto, and mutant encounters set in the Civil rights movement/the Vietnam War. When Singer took over, he integrated these concepts into a viral marketing campaign to set up the action of the film. In this alternate history, Magneto is arrested and imprisoned for the assassination of Kennedy, but maintains his innocence. The ""Bent Bullet"" Theory (a reference to the real life ""Magic Bullet"" Theory criticized by conspiracy theorists) holds that the Warren Commission determined that Magneto manipulated Lee Harvey Osawld's bullets to kill the President in retribution for the murder of the mutants Azazel and Tempest by the CIA. Conspiracy theorists, based on Magneto's testimony, insist however that Magneto had tried to prevent the murder of Kennedy, and that the true shooter was not Oswald, but Mystique in disguise who, with the help of Emma Frost framed Magneto, and manipulated Jack Ruby into later murdering Oswald. The theory also posits that Mystique offered to double as Kennedy in an attempt to grab power, all of which backfired horribly, leading to anti-mutant hostilities."
Andres Gomez,"Not as good as the previous X-Men movies but it has a pass... Jennifer Lawrence doesn't even get close to Rebecca Romijn. Also, Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy are really far from their senior characters performed by Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart but the rest of original cast from first 2000's movie are great, as always."
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"This is a good and very enjoyable movie which, to me, was a bit surprising since I generally find that time travel is akin to sticking your foot in some messy and smelly stuff. It almost always screws up the movie in some way or another. This one was not without its faults but it did survive becoming too screwed up by it.

The opening scenes are indeed somewhat impressive throwing the viewer directly into an apocalyptic future where mutants as well as human are rounded up by sentinels. I could not help but think about Terminator during these scenes. Maybe not very original from a general point of view but the dark and gloomy opening was not the opening scenes I would have expected from an X-Men movie.

Then we, unfortunately, dive straight into some time travel when they send Wolverine back to 1973. This is of course a opportunity to make yet another twist of the mutant scare, mutants hunt, a good mutant is a dead mutant etc. story that we have seen in so many movies now. The main adversary changes but the general story idea stays the same and the arguments for hunting down the mutants are as silly as ever. Quite frankly, I find that angle a wee bit overdone and boring by now.

Luckily the story is fairly well implemented. The scene were Wolverine wakes up and disposes of the three thugs are rather funny. Pretty standard stuff but pretty funny nevertheless. The part where they retrieve Magneto is quite nice and the scene down in the Pentagon where the guards and everything else is “frozen” while Maximoff calmly walks around and rearranges things is outright hilarious.

I quite disliked the cheap twist where Magneto just decided to go amok and screw things up just when they were about to retrieve Mystique though. They could have spent some time coming up with a better way to twist the story at that time. The idiotic stuff with Wolverine getting a fit at the same time was just adding to my annoyance with that scene. This part is the main reason I will not give this movie a top score.

Apart from this scene the movie is a very well done superhero movie with lots of nice special effects. Sure it is also rather predictable but most people, including myself, do watch these movies mostly for the effects after all. As long as the plot is not downright stupid it get to pass.

Time travel. Okay, I have to harp a bit about time travel. I do not like it in movies because there are too many things that just does not add up. In this movie it is not too bad and most of the time the actual time travel aspect is kept out of the action. Wolverine goes back in time, does his stuff with a lot of action, and saves the day. Sure the dialog often comes back to the “I’m from the future” aspect but not much more. One thing annoys the hell out me though. Wolverine affects a lot of events while he is back there but not a single things seems to change in the future until one single event passes at the end of the movie. Then everything changes and it is happy ending. That is the kind of nonsense that time travel in movies ends up with.

Bottom line is that this is a very enjoyable movie. Without the rubbish plot twist in the middle it would have gotten 9 or 10 stars."
flabob257,ok..i like all the x-mens except the last one.  Logan.   That was horrible.  a 8 out of 10 for this
Wuchak,"***Focuses on the best characters and an interesting story***  

""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" (2014) starts in an apocalyptic near-future where mutants are being wiped out by Sentinels, government-made robots created for this very purpose. The X-Men and Magneto decide to send Wolverine's consciousness back to his body in 1973 to prevent the Sentinels from attaining their mutant-killing powers.

This is easily one of the best X-Men films because of the interesting plot and the focus on the most interesting characters. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) has been the top X-Men since day one so you can't go wrong with making him the focal point. James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart are excellent as Professor X, as are Michael Fassbender as young Magneto, Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique and Evan Peters as Quicksilver, the latter in a small but highly entertaining role. Nicholas Hoult as Beast gets an honorable mention and Bingbing Fan is notable as Blink, particularly her stunning face. 

The plot is convoluted and yet easy to follow if you're familiar with the franchise's story arc. The film is all-around compelling. It has the confidence to slow down and be pensive while throwing in the requisite thrills and not forgetting to be entertaining. For instance, the creative and amusing way Quicksilver takes down a bunch of security guards at the Pentagon, which is one of the movie's top scenes. Lastly, I like the way Magneto’s great power is illustrated (you’ll see what I mean).  

The film runs 2 hours, 11 minutes and was shot in Québec, Canada. 

GRADE: A"
CinemaSerf,"So in the best spirit of ""Terminator"", the X-Men conclude that the best way of securing the future is to send ""Wolverine"" (Hugh Jackman) into the past to try to stop history from causing the demise of both human and mutant alike. Why? Well that's because they realise that modern science, which has created the unstoppable robotic ""Sentinels"", is capable of destroying all in it's path - and them fighting each other will merely ensure they all end up going the way of the dodo. The task assigned to ""Wolverine"" is to try and convince the 1973 version of ""Mystique"" (Jennifer Lawrence) upon whose DNA these metallic creations are based, to co-operate - and that is not going to be an easy task. Especially as she has no idea that she is the crucial source of their genetics. This is easily the best of the series for my money. The amalgam of new and old cast deliver the best, meatiest, of the stories efficiently and entertainingly. ""Wolverine"" takes the lead but there is plenty of scope for the other characters to shine, use their powers, have a bit of romance and generally keep this 2¼ hour action adventure moving along quickly. We are spared much of the repetitive close-combat scenes that Jackman's character usually delivers; the visual effects are lively and vibrant and the denouement offers a degree of food for thought amidst the chaos and mayhem. Great to watch on a big screen and well anchored by the (slightly side-lined) Thespians, this is well worth a watch."
mooney240,"**X-Men: Days of Future Past leverages time travel to bring its expansive universe and different casts together for one of the most powerful and entertaining superhero epics ever made.**

Days of Future Past was the pinnacle of the 20th Century Fox X-Men franchise. It beautifully unites the original cast with the First Class cast in one of the best X-Men comic book stories. The story feels urgent and high stakes right from the beginning, with the world destroyed and only a small band of mutants fighting to survive and try to prevent this apocalyptic future. The time travel plot of the film allows Hugh Jackman to interact with McAvoy and the young X-Men but also bring back the older cast and correct some of the franchise's past mistakes. Evan Peters' Quicksilver offers some of the movie's best moments with his silly but technically stunning scenes. Seeing Stewart and McKellen back and seeing their performances contrasted with McAvoy and Fassbender was incredible. With great highs like X2 and First Class and disappointing lows like Last Stand and Dark Phoenix, Days of Future Past rises as the best X-Men movie and one of the best comic book films of all time."
Andres Gomez,"Weak story for a movie with a huge budget.

Honestly, I think you will only like it if you are a Treky. In no other way you will be able to get any logic out of it and the fact that the Captain of the space ship is the first to get out to do field work."
Gimly,"**The following is a long form review that I originally wrote in 2013.**

_Star Trek: Into Darkness_, or _STID_, as the kids are calling it (which makes me sad 'cause it's akin to both STI's and STD's) is, in my unprofessional opinion, a step up from the previous instalment (which I did still quite enjoy).

Both J.J. Abram's 2009 film, as well as _Into Darkness_ did both, however, seem to have an issue I couldn't overlook in common. And that is that both essentially feel like an incredibly drawn out episode of a TV show. And I've seen next to nothing of the old _Star Trek_ series, so it's not from that sort of a view I've come to have this feeling. It's just a sort of unshakable notion I developed after a few minutes from the start during each film. Even in this aspect, _Into Darkness_ is a slight improvement on its forebear.

This new _Star Trek_ film is, unfortunately, riddled with plot holes. Some... Or at least one, is completely unforgivable. They're not enough to ruin the film per se, but it does make me wonder about Abram's ability to be a showrunner in the future if he can't even handle _Star Trek_. Right from the get go I had questions that could have easily been answered with only a couple of lines of dialogue's worth of effort. Which was sad, because it cast a pall over what was, at its heart, an enjoyable piece of cinema.

Despite these issues worsening as the movie progressed, a congratulatory word does again have to go out to Abram's and his team for their tweaked timeline. Working a way in which to successfully reboot the franchise, without belittling the integrity of the original was a great move (moreover, they've left themselves open for more deviations in the future, now that the concept is established). Very smart.

Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, John Cho and Anton Yelchin returning is of course a big plus for me. Completely unsurprisingly there just as fantastic as ever. But, that kind of Tumblr user would I be if I didn't give a special bit of praise to Benedict Cumberbatch (which all levity aside, is actually well earned from the Brit, who makes for a spectacular villain).

Andres Gomez,Boring and with low quality animations.
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"Me and the kids watched this movie yesterday evening. We all liked it quite a lot. This is a very enjoyable family movie. It is, not surprisingly, a new twist on the old Jack and the Beanstalk story. The basic elements are there, Jack, beans, beanstalks and, of course, giants. A few new elements are thrown in like a Crown to control the giants, a treacherous bastard responsible for the entire mess and a few other things.

The giants are very well done. The CGI is good to very good most of the time. As can be expected, it is the giants that make up this movie. I would say that they are slightly scary (for kids) and rather funny at the same time. Unfortunately the same cannot be said about the human actors. The acting is generally not so good and sometimes downright abysmal. It is rather surprising for such a relatively big production to have such poor TV-show quality acting.

The bottom line is that it is a very enjoyable family movie. If you watch it as an adult I guess you must have a liking for special effects and CGI, which I do, in order to enjoy it."
Wuchak,"***Medieval fairy tale with a noble hero, a beautiful princess and hordes of barbaric giants***

Released in 2013 and directed by Bryan Singer, “Jack the Giant Slayer” has plot similarities to 1962’s “Jack the Giant Killer” with Nicholas Hoult playing the wholesome farm boy, Eleanor Tomlinson the winsome princess and Ian McShane the king. The rural protagonist slays a couple giants and rescues the royal maiden, but that’s where the similarities between the two movies end. This one lacks an evil wizard and his dark castle, which are substituted by the brutal giants and the colossal beanstalk that leads up to their awesome realm above the clouds.

Despite the almost $200 million spent mostly on the CGI giants & their world, “Jack the Giant Slayer” just isn’t as compelling as “Jack the Giant Killer,” which had super-cheesy effects, albeit charming. Yes, the giants & their realm look superb, as far as cartoonish CGI goes, but more time & money needed spent on the characters and their story to hook the viewer. In other words, despite all the action/adventure and millions blown on CGI, the story’s generally meh.

Nonetheless, the flick’s good enough if you favor CGI-laden films like “King Kong” (2005) and “Avatar” (2009). Hoult and Tomlinson are more-than-worthy as the protagonists with Hoult being reminiscent of Richard Thomas. I just wish the script fleshed them out more and made us care about them and their considerable challenges.

The film runs 1 hour, 54 minutes and was shot in England (Surrey, Norfolk & Somerset). ADDITIONAL CAST: Ewan McGregor plays a knight, Stanley Tucci a royal bastage and Eddie Marsan his inane crony.

GRADE: C+/B-"
Andres Gomez,"Baz Luhrmann repeats what he did with Rome + Juliet and creates a horrible moster full of FX and exaggeration.

Still, the cast performs well."
anthonyryan1,"An over the top portrayal of the classic novel, while at times excessive and tasteless, it truly hits home with the novels original critique on the excess of the time. The cast was **excellent**, the movie stayed true to the novel in all the most important ways. I personally feel the modern soundtrack wasn't appropriate in several cases, but a couple flawless executions."
John Chard,"Sands to the future.

I guess ultimately it is what it is, a Disney backed video game adaptation of the blockbuster kind.

In truth it works just fine and dandy as a family fantasy adventure, with swords and sandals - shields and sarongs, all in abundance. There's the mythical and the magical, the swish and the swash, the HD photography a treat for the eyes. The leads are pretty, likable and energetic, and even though it consistently reminds us that it is based on a video game (jumping and rolling, jumping and rolling), the choreography is niftily arranged and there's a lovely old fashioned feel to the story; which works in that wonderful Sinbadish way.

Not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, and if one was so inclined? One could deconstruct the faults of the production with the same clinical impact of that achieved by Ben Kingsley's (Sir) wallet when it hit the floor after this paycheck was deposited. It should be viewed in the spirit of how Alfred Molina plays his character, with tongue in cheek and a complete understanding of how to have a good time with popcorn fluff. Prince of Persia is forgettable come the end credits, but at least it was a fun date. And for that we are truly grateful. 7/10"
Gimly,"It's very, very bad but I guess I was in just the right mood for it because I actually kind of enjoyed watching _Prince of Persia_. I can't pinpoint even a single good thing about it, whereas I can immediately conjure many of its failings, but I just remember having some fun. 

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
r96sk,"Never played the video game, but I enjoyed this film suitably.

It has flaws, though there's enough to like about <em>'Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time'</em>. I rate Jake Gyllenhaal as an actor, while I don't think he's perfect for this role I did enjoy his performance all in all. The special effects are neat, especially for the dagger. The support cast are satisfactory, Alfred Molina being the standout behind Gyllenhaal.

The premise is a pretty fascinating one, but I don't feel there is enough there for a near 2hr production. It felt, a number of times, that the story was going round in circles and overextending itself in order to fill the run time, there are many times where 'A' runs from 'B', 'B' finds 'A' instantly, 'A' gets away. In many different guises, but it kept happening.

Could've been far greater, but I still come away from viewing this fairly positively."
GeekMasher,"First I want to say I liked this movie. I was surprised, I've been hearing bad reviews but I can't see big problem. The only issues was with the story. Apart from that the graphics where very good. The actors where okay (no major actors) and the baddies (no spoilers) where well thought out and graphically impressive (same for the robots).

All in all a good movie."
Matt Golden,"When monstrous, building-sized creatures (dubbed ""kaiju"") hell-bent on destruction begin pouring out of an extra-dimensional fissure at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, humanity bands together to build titanic mechas called jaegers, each controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are linked through a neural bond called ""The Drift."" As the kaiju get stronger and the signs point to an all-out flood of the beasts, the fate of humanity looks bleak, and the surviving jaegers are brought together for one last-ditch attempt at saving the world.

After an agonizingly long five-year wait, filled with some heartbreaking starts and stops (like the almost-weres of The Hobbit and At the Mountains of Madness), Guillermo del Toro has finally returned with his biggest budget and story yet. The Mexican master of fantasy returns to the toybox of his youth, drawing from the kaiju films of old (Godzilla, Gamera, Mothra, and the like) and anime to create the modern-day monster movie we didn't even know we wanted.

I am a genre man through and through, and del Toro's films are filled with both the intelligence of the best of science fiction, fantasy, and horror and a flawlessly-rendered vision unique to him. His innate knowledge of what makes those outlandish stories truly matter to us is the backbone of his work as a writer and director, and his visual style is one that invokes true wonder.

It's that wonder, that childlike glee that makes Pacific Rim work so well, and well it does work. This is a brawny, massive film made by a true artist and auteur at the top of his game, but while the technicals of this film could have been mounted by any number of working directors, the magic of Guillermo del Toro is that he infuses every film with himself. His love of the material, whatever it may be, shines brightly through every frame. It is this complete sincerity that makes his films such a joy to experience, and even when there are 250-foot behemoths slugging it out on the screen, there's not a trace of the disastrous irony or cynicism so readily supplied by other blockbusters anywhere to be found.

The cast gamely comes to play, with Idris Elba (TV’s Luther) as Stacker Pentecost (one of my favorite character names of all time) as the stoic leader of the jaeger program, Charlie Hunnam (TV’s Sons of Anarchy) as former pilot Raleigh Becket, who suffered a tragic loss and has to be convinced to return to jaeger service, and Oscar-nominated Rinko Kinkuchi (Babel) as Mako Mori, another life touched by the kaiju and ready to serve up some righteous fury. If these sound like tried-and-true archetypes, it’s because they are. This is a grand, epic war film on a bigger scale than anything ever attempted before in that genre, and one of the strokes of genius from del Toro and original writer Travis Beacham is that we instantly establish and identify with the characters onscreen. There are so many ideas flying around (monsters, mechas, neural bonding, kaiju culture, and many, many more) that the broadly-drawn characters serve as a perfect anchor for the audience, immediately relatable in their inherent humanity.

It seems that the mission statment of this movie was, in a word, “texture.” Del Toro delivered a visual feast unlike any other big spectacle films, with his insistence on it not looking like a “glossy car commercial.” Instead, every frame is filled with rain, snow, scuffs, smoke, debris, and other visual elements that reflect the weight and dimension of these cyclopean combatants. Unlike the ultra-glossy (and emotionally irrelevant) Transformers films, or virtually any other modern big-budget actioner, this universe feels dirty, grungy, and lived-in, like the original Star Wars trilogy.

In fact, dubbing a film “this generation’s Star Wars” has been overused to the point of robbing the phrase of all meaning. But Pacific Rim feels just like that. It invokes those most elusive of emotions in the modern studio film: wonder, awe, and sheer enjoyment. Do you remember the awe you felt upon seeing a Star Destroyer creep onto the screen? Discovering a brachiosaurus on Isla Nublar? Laying eyes on the verdant fields of Middle Earth? This film has that. No one builds worlds like del Toro, and here he is, the master, inviting you to play in his sandbox with him. Grab your favorite action figure and hop in."
VolcanoAl,My favorite movie for years!!!I absolutely love this movie!No big story.A lot of action.The only bad thing is all the fights are at night & in the rain.A bright daylight fight would have really made it great!!!
Andres Gomez,"This movie has almost everything that is expected from it so just relax lay back with the pop corn and your soft drink and enjoy.

Just to make noticeable the remarkable few amount of females featuring in the movie and how bad is that Travis Beacham and Guillermo del Toro just copy Evangelion's idea without giving anything back."
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"I have to say that I enjoyed this pure special effects movie quite a lot even though the plot is totally ridiculous. Clumsy giant robots beating at alien beasts with their fists should be better than modern tanks and airplanes with modern explosive and armor penetrating weapons? As I said, a ridiculous story. Well it does not really matter does it because the story gives an excuse for some real cool special effects loaded action. Giant robots and alien Godzillas in the same movie. Cool, simply cool.

Once you have gotten past the silliness of the story it is a very entertaining rollercoaster ride of action. The scenes where the robots and aliens go head to head is visually very enjoyable. Sometimes they make you laugh as well. For instance the scene where Gipsy Danger (one of the robots) drags a cargo ship after it to use as a club.

Unfortunately a somewhat somber mood is set right from the start by the fact that the Jaeger program is discontinued. Not because they are really defenseless as the movie blurb states but because dumbass politicians wants to save money as usual. Instead they build giant walls that are subsequently breached in hours. As I said, dumbass politicians. I guess they wanted to put some realism into the movie!

As much as the robot and alien action is tremendously enjoyable I think some of my favorite scenes are the ones with Ron Perlman as Hannibal Chau. I have always liked Ron Perlman and he is simply outrageously (as in funny) wacky as Hannibal Chau.

The one thing I did not like with the movie is the ludicrous nonsense statements about the dinosaurs being the first attempt at an invasion. Whoever wrote that must be an idiot. Worse, the fact that it made it into the movie means that someone believes that the audience are idiots. When it then was followed by some green-religious crap that the atmosphere was not right for them then but that we have now “terraformed” earth for them by our pollution it was at least a star off just for that. I hate it when they put crap like that in the movies. It is an insult to the audience.

Anyway, despite the dinosaur nonsense I found it a very enjoyable movie. Without that it would have received a near top rating but as I said, it is at least a star off due to that crap."
Teemu,"Watching a CGI heavy movie 5 years following its release doesn't sound like such a hot idea, but in the case of Pacific Rim nothing really drew me out of the experience in terms of aging animation.

However, the film itself was an 'okay' at best. Aside from the spectacle CGI fights of giants robots versus giant alien monsters it doesn't offer anything of value. This is one of those movies you can safely keep on your second monitor and zone out in between the set piece fight scenes."
mooney240,"**Pacific Rim is outrageous and cliche but loads of fun if you embrace it for what it is: insane robot/monster action.**

Pacific Rim is a ridiculous action monster movie that is a lot of fun if you have the right expectations. It’s a film about giant rock em sock em robots fighting giant Godzilla-like monsters, filled with shallow characters, goofy dialogue, great thrills, and exciting action sequences. Charlie Day’s wacky scientist was exceedingly annoying, but then you also have Idris Elba’s inspiring gritty performance of Stacker Pentecost in the same film. Those two performances perfectly define the movie as one of extremes. Extreme robot monster action. Extreme goofiness. All mixed in together for a unique movie worth a watch but not the movie hall of fame."
LastCaress1972,"Transformers: Dark of the Moon. 154 minutes long, so Wiki tells me (although whilst watching it it felt as though it flew by in a mere, ooh, fourteen hours or so?). 154 minutes. And I was lost, bored and checking my watch before the fourth minute. So I shall attempt to review a movie I have only just seen but about which I know almost nothing, and about which I care considerably less than that. The following will be far less a coherent review than a disjointed mess. Well, fine. Seems perfectly apt.

So, years ago, the old Autobot leader Sentinel Prime crashed into the moon along with some teleporter doowacky - made up of hundreds of ""pillars"" - that only he can control. The Decepticons swiped almost all the pillars but left Sentinel there. On a routine military... um... I'm not sure; Jolly Boy's Outing? Optimus Prime gets into a fracas with Decepticon Shockwave and finds a couple of these pillars. He then throws a strop 'cos the humans knew about this bit of Cybertron kit but never told him, but now they're more than happy to, I suppose. Um. So Optimus rocks up to the moon and finds Sentinel Prime and revives him. Turns out this is what the Decepticons wanted; only Optimus could revive him and only Sentinel can work the teleporter doowacky (the ""Bridge""). So now they're after Sentinel. But OH NOES, Sentinel has decided that the Autobots are fighting a lost cause, so he's throwing in with the Decepticons anyway. Cue lots of deeply confusing and tedious ""Tranny-Slapping"" as I have just dubbed the Transformer skirmishes as Megatron, Sentinel and the baddies try to use the Bridge to... um, pull their faraway home of Cybertron to Earth? Or turn Earth into Cybertron? Or something.

Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky* (Shia LaBeouf, even more punchable than usual, which by his standards is quite something) is not just a useless nerd this time around, he's also a whingeing **** who wants a) international acclaim and credit (other than the medal awarded him by the president of course!) for his part in saving the world twice even though nobody knows that that's what he's done, and b) a 40-hour job. Anything really; Trolley-dolly at Asda/Walmart will be fine. Despite all this he seems to have effortlessly brushed off Megan Fox and continued to punch way, way above his weight with his new squeeze, Rosie DoubleBarrelled-Surname: English, impossibly attractive, permanently dressed for all occasions - work, play, sleep, dragging her ****hole across the carpet like a worm-ridden doggie - like a $200-an-hour prostitute, and, incredibly, at least 40% stupider even than Ms. Fox, who as we know is marginally less alert and responsive than a squeezed tube of Anusol. How does Sam fit in to the so-called ""plot""? Who knows. Double-Barrelled's smarmy, supercar-distributing walking hard-on of a boss turns out to be a Decepticon bitch (Deceptibitch?), and... oh, Christ knows. Alls I DO know is that this time around, Frances McDormand and John Malkovich have joined John Turturro in shilling for dollars like a ****-flashing strumpet. ""Me so shaaaameless."" ""Me overact LONG time!"" ""Me so shaaaameless."" Sucky-f*cky, five million dollar?

From the very first second to the very last, the whole thing is needlessly convoluted, comically unfeasible - even within its own logic, such as that is - and most crucially, lifeforce-sappingly dull. Just like the other two movies, and of course just like the Transformers themselves. At one point, maybe two-thirds in (or maybe seven weeks in, who knows?), the angsty, poignant strains of a generic rock ballad signalled the arrival of a ""sad"" scene. On-screen, people crouched and clasped their heads in anguish, weeping and hugging in amongst considerable swathes of burning scenery and unspecifiable wreckage. I'm not sure why this bit was to be considered sad or poignant; perhaps the entire cast simultaneously realised they were in a Transformers movie.

Awful, awful. As bad as anything Bay has ever shat out during his spiteful, cynical, moviegoer-hating and barely-disguised subterfuge as a ""film director""."
John Chard,"Life in the old dog yet.

Indiana Jones is called back into action when he becomes entangled in a Soviet plot to uncover the secret behind mysterious artifacts known as the Crystal Skulls.

So here it is, the fourth instalment of the Indiana Jones series is finally here, one of the most talked about, most anticipated, and most yearned for films is here to hopefully entertain the fans and maybe garner some new ones in the process?? Does it deliver? Well to me it most certainly does, as adventure yarns go, this is a ripper, and although the plot gets lost within the outlandish ideals, the film still emerges as one of the betert popcorn blockbusters of the year. All the chief ingredients that have made the franchise so beloved are crammed in by way of crowd pleasing necessity, and it damn well works, outrageous action sequences perk us up at frequent intervals, deftly self aware comic moments are many, and crucially, the film remains loyal to the heroic good against evil spirit of the franchise.

We begin in the Nevada Desert in 1957, and it's through this 50s setting that we come to accept the ageing of the main protagonist, he is after all a mere mortal, a man with a whip and a bit of guts. The 50s was a time of paranoia, spies and dubious cover ups were all the rage, this shines through from the outset here, and putting an aged Indiana Jones in this time frame is nothing short of genius. But enough of the politics, we as fans just want to be entertained, and we are well served here, spooky chambers, mysterious civilisations, tricksy maps, unfathomable codes, creepy crawlies, peril at every turn, and stuntery abound, oh yes it's all here. However, the purists will hate the use of CGI in this, and for sure it does grate during one over extended sequence, but just like it didn't stop Stephen Sommers' The Mummy being a riot, it doesn't harm this picture either, we are after all talking about a popcorn actioner here. Surely going into a film of this type one immediately suspends disbelief? I mean I'm personally going into the cinema to escape for a couple of hours, and Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull is just what the doctor ordered, with a lollipop to follow for good behaviour.

The cast are a mixed bunch, Ford easily carries off the role as the older Indiana Jones, very aware and with tongue firmly in cheek, he surely has rammed all the pre-negative vibes down the throats of the doom mongers. Shia LaBeouf fits into the series with no problems at all, spunky and witty, he adds the young sparkle needed to off set the aged nature of our hero, and he gets a quite delightful entrance to boot. Ray Winstone is an odd casting choice because his character is very underwritten, if you are going to utilise the big Englishman then give him the reins to take, he's gruff and watchable but it remains a case of wasting talent. Karen Allen joyfully reappears as Marion, and the film takes a significant leap upwards once she arrives, however the character is reduced to playing fourth fiddle in the ensuring shenanigans, and as much as the interplay with Indy still sparkles, you can't help hankering for much more from our Marion. Cate Blanchet is sparky as Irina Spalko but although as our chief villain of the piece she's tough, sexy, and not to be messed with, it's a turn that is never quite fully formed. John Hurt does the best he can with what little the role calls for, whilst Jim Broadbent barely gets time to fill the considerable boots left by Denholm Elliott's Marcus Brody.

Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull will divide fans and newcomers alike, but I honestly say without nostalgia rearing its head, that this film is a joy ride to be judged on its own merit. It's difficult to understand some of the venom aimed at this latest instalment, it's not like anything has really changed with the formula, Indiana Jones has always been about fun, nothing more and nothing less, just remember why you fell in love with the franchise in the first place and you will see the makers here have given the fans what they wanted. Perhaps the advent of time and the new technology available has a hindrance value for sure, but although Indy 4 obviously isn't quite the impacting franchise jolt that Bond got with ""Casino Royale"", it's sure as hell shown ""Die Hard 4"" how it should have be done. 8/10"
Kamurai,"Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.

I'm always confused on when this movie is supposed to happen, and too many people get caught up in the involvement of Shia Lebouf to think too hard about it.

This movie catches a lot of flak for Shia and half a dozen other things, but  compared to the original 3 movies, the concepts of a crystal skull aren't any more weird.  While people forget that aspects of the first 3 artifacts are real, the crystal skulls are a real thing that is actively being investigated.  Because it's caught up in all the ""alien conspiracy"" communities I think the movie absorbed some of the ridicule of those people.

The story itself is well structured, Cate Blanchett and Karen Allen are welcome are awesome additions to the story, and despite the ""sci-fi"" element from an alien skull, the movie keeps to a archaeological theme by investigating an ancient temple site.

While I'm not going to re-watch this, please ignore the negative hype and give this a try if you like a good action adventure story."
Reno,"> Arlo and Spot's adventure to the Clawtooth Mountain.

To be honest, I have been looking forward this since the day I came to know about it. But it took so long to come out, even the Windows OS has upgraded thrice since then. After all these years, now I feel this is not what I wanted. It should have been different, especially the story. It was a fine animation, including all the technical aspect had no issues, but the story was not convincing.

Seemed just like another version of 'The Croods'. In fact, crossover between these two would be awesome like the boy from this and the family from other title as an original family who lost each other for some reason. But the trouble is, both are from the different production house and coming together is a tough task.

The civilised dinosaurs? That's kind of weird, but in a children's story and animation, all are fair. So I turned into one and enjoyed it. Apatosaurus are farmers, T-Rex are cowboys, yeah whole new perspective, apart from the humans who are still in lower on the chart of dominance and intelligent.

In my opinion, I'm being honest with what I felt. The theme about self discovery and to throw away fear is inspiring for the little children. At a same time, it is not a freshly developed story, kind of reminds 'The Lion King'. I know they're not same, but the initial parts are, between father and son. You can watch it once or twice, because it is not a boring film, but not the best.

Travis Bell,"I enjoyed Brave but it wasn't without a few flaws.

First of all, I never felt like there was much meat to the story. It was enjoyable sure, and had some good morals and family values but I never felt like I was invested in the main characters. Stuff just seemed to happen.

Secondly, and this isn't as much the movies fault as perhaps the marketing that surrounded it, but it was actually a very different movie than I thought it was going to be. I discovered that it's hard to break those pre-conceptions as I kept thinking the story was going somewhere else than it did.

Brave was at its best when it made me laugh which  unfortunately, was just too seldom. For example, the entire scene where the 3 clans try to fight for Mérida's hand was way too short!

The voice cast was very good though. Kelly Macdonald in particular, was perfect as Mérida.

All in all, Brave was good but not great. It just seems to lack the ""magic"" I expect from Pixar. Not their worst outing but close to it."
Gimly,"The following is a long-form review that I originally wrote in 2012.

The film in all was a relatively decent venture. Perhaps Pixar's well deserved success is its pitfall here. Though highly enjoyable, Brave was simply not up to the standard brought forth by the likes of the Toy Story trilogy, Up or Monsters Inc. ?This movie falls more into the category of ""Entertaining, acceptable, cute"" instead of the higher echelons some of the studio's past work has earned it.

Brave attempts to take the ""Disney Princess"" line away from its predecessors in which princesses are only good for getting themselves into trouble so that men can rescue them (ie. Snow White, Belle, etc.) or in the case of the Little Mermaid in which she is willing to almost literally walk on broken glass for a man simply because he's pretty. And for this, we thank Brave. All that said and done however, there was one rather unfortunate side-effect of all this. I at first simply felt it was my warped interpretation, but every person whom I've spoken to drew the same conclusion, so perhaps not... Now, I'm sure it wasn't intentional, but, I must say, the main character Merida... Seemed to... Have a thing for her mum. Just saying, honestly, that's how the piece feels as it plays out.

On a less incestuous note though, stand up comic/actor Billy Connolly as Meridia's father King Fergus is simply brilliant, and probably the highest point of the whole film. Though the animation didn't exactly make leaps and bounds forward in comparison to anything else that's come out in the past couple of years, it was still most certainly impressive.

Maybe if I had been part of Brave's target audience I could have appreciated the movie more. It was most certainly good, but I wasn't really ?blown away? by any aspect of the film whatsoever. It managed to scrape a slight ""above average"" but I really would have liked something more than I got, especially seeing as movies on the big screen tend to impress me more readily.
Brave's biggest problem is that it is, in essence, forgettable. Though an entertaining 93 minutes to be sure, I can't imagine myself hankering for a re-watch any time soon.

r96sk,"A wholehearted animated film from Disney.

<em>'Brave'</em> is very good. The Scottish vibes help a lot, but the meaningful message and superb animation are just a few of the film's other big positives. The casting, characters and music are some too. The premise itself isn't anything breathtakingly new, but is most certainly enjoyable to see unfold.

The cast are excellent, with my personal standouts being Kelly Macdonald (Merida) and Emma Thompson (Elinor). There are also good performances from Billy Connolly (Fergus), Robbie Coltrane (Dingwall) and Julie Walters (Witch).

It's a fun and simple watch, one I thoroughly felt entertained by."
CinemaSerf,"To be honest, I was expecting rather more from this feature. It centres around the tomboyish princess ""Merida"" who is being groomed by her fastidious mother 'Elinor"" into a refined and genteel lady befitting her station. Her father, ""Fergus"" is a bit rougher round the edges but by and large the family - along with the two younger twin boys - rub along ok. That is, until the king and queen announce to their daughter that it is time for her betrothal - and that she just marry one of the pretty hapless heirs from one of the three great clans of the kingdom. Unimpressed, she runs away and encounters a witch who agrees to cast a spell that will change her mother's mind... Well it does a load more than that, and soon the young ""Merida"" has to reconcile the fall out from her hastily sought wish as well as fend of a legendary bear that has already robbed the King of half of his leg. The adventure is entertaining enough, but the story is too thin to stretch for ninety minutes and despite some characterful and amusing efforts from Julie Walters, Billy Connolly and Emma Thompson, I found this just a bit slow. The accents are Scottish, but it really could have been set anywhere and be about anything. The standard of animation isn't brilliant either - it has a very linear style to it that I didn't think so natural, especially as much of this takes place outdoors in a dense and colourful forest. It's still an engaging family film though, one that you could safely leave the youngsters in front of without worry. One from the factory, you might say."
Frank Ochieng,"Some diehard **Star Trek** fans may not necessarily feel that the Justin Lin-directed third installment of this science fiction/space saga film franchise “boldly goes where no man has gone before” creatively. Surprisingly, Lin (director of two “Fast & Furious” flicks) shows some engaging and intriguing heft in **Star Trek Beyond** as the adventurous exploits of the USS Enterprise crew are likely to stir the collective pot where the nostalgic sentiments of the Star Trek brand from yesteryear bridges the gap to the current cinematic explosiveness of modern-day Captain Kirk and company. Although it is extremely difficult to immediately dismiss filmmaker J.J. Abrams’s resourceful fingerprints concerning the imaginative **Star Trek** (2009) and the thoroughly enjoyable **Star Trek Into Darkness** (2013) he graciously steps aside to allow Lin’s energizing directorial vision to further explore Trek mythology on the big screen.

Essentially, **Star Trek Beyond** is a vibrant cosmic canvas that is expansive in its boundaries of exploration. Visually arresting, well-paced and armed with compelling story-telling and a healthy dosage of curiosity and mystery, Lin manages to stay true to the traditional Trek-oriented universe by incorporating rousing special effects and offering a galactic grandeur of planetary peculiarities and exotic alien races to stimulate the exquisite narrative. Screenwriters Doug Jung and Simon Pegg (Star Trek’s on-screen character Montgomery “Scotty” Scott) incorporate an eye-opening mixture of dramatic edginess, off-the-cuff humor and the cohesive rapport among the cast-mates that have inherited the iconic Star Trek personalities and made these familiar faces from the classic 60’s TV show and previous non-reboot films a revelation in the millennium age of blockbuster sci-fi action adventure.

The plot channels in a sense of challenging malaise for the USS Enterprise’s top officers in Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto). What seemingly spices things up regarding the deja vu space journeys aboard the spacecraft is the questionable and powerful device that Kirk and his crew are babysitting. This powerful tool of destruction is capable of destroying humanity as we know it. In particular, the opportunistic Krall (Idris Elba) is the lizard-looking culprit determined to get his diabolical hands on the corrosive contraption. Naturally, Krall and his menacing minions must subdue Kirk and his crew to achieve success in having this ominous object in his deadly grasp. Krall’s willingness to cripple the USS Enterprise proved to be an ambitious mission fully accomplished. For Kirk and his group the results were disheartening as Krall’s forceful attacks rendered the ship disabled as it crashed on the desolate planet of Altamid. Thus, Kirk and his charges are stranded on his rocky haven with no hope in sight. The harsh reality for the vulnerable USS Enterprise visitors, besides being divided and scattered in all directions on this problematic planet, involved getting into survival mode as the hostile reptilian creatures surrounded them at will.

The aforementioned split of Kirk and his exposed cohorts called for a series of various crisis carried on at different, chaotic spots. Kirk and Russian crew member Pavel Chekov (played by the late Anton Yelchin) were primarily tasked with trying to rescue their colleagues from the claws of Krall and his cronies. Elsewhere, Dr. Bones (Keith Urban) tries to patch up the injured Spock following the aftermath of the ship’s wrecking. Pegg’s Scotty and womanly warrior in alien Jayla (Sofia Boutella) make the valiant effort in trying to reach Kirk in the middle of total ribaldry.

**Star Trek Beyond** has stylized flash and Lin ensures that his pulsating production stays faithful to the Trek legacy. Sure, **Beyond** is not anything innovative or wildly distinctive in comparison to the other earlier entries but it still thrives where it counts in the spectacle of space-aged escapism. The cast is solid as the players–Pine, Quinto, Pegg, Urban, Yelchin as well as Zoe Saldana’s Uhura and John Cho’s Sulu–all demonstrate a suspenseful unity on screen and give the audience an indescribable excitement in this latest chapter that far from disappoints. Elba’s Krall is robustly villainous in physicality and attitude and the alien race featured are interestingly hypnotic in creepiness. Lin, in the same vein as Abrams, is not shy about gift-wrapping his **Star Trek** edition in boisterous, sweeping helpings of scope and whimsy.

Overall, this kinetic outing of **Beyond** practically guarantees that the rebooted **Star Trek** phenomenon will not be experiencing its final frontier any time soon.

Linda Robinson,"I saw this movie two hours ago and I can't remember how it started. Ah. Diplomatic mission to offer a truce artifact to one of the warring sides from the other. It does not go well. Just a tad shy of 3 years into the 5 year mission and Kirk is bored enough to take a desk job. Screenplay set-up signifying it's all about to get much less stultifying. I don't know enough about camera angle choices to know if that's what makes the film feel disjointed, or the script, or editing chops, but something certainly felt unconnected. I started noticing details I had no business noticing. Everybody's hair is bigger. I watched Galaxy Quest recently, and when Krall showed up I choked on popcorn. In fact, prosthetics needed an above the title billing. Running from intruders in a dark corridor, I could see Uhura's earrings glinting. If I could see those, the enemy could, too. The device designed to End The Universe is too much like Big Hero 6. The space station too much like Elysium. And the jumpstart of a starship too much like Furious 7. One of these days in the near future scenic designers will stop putting skyscrapers on hula hoops in deep space. And it's a space station - where are all the people running to when the bad stuff starts happening? It's a scene device that needs to go. The Bad Dude airship docking station is right out of Independence Day. Can we get a little new here? Visual effects are gooey (literally) with some stuff that may or may not be a cue to the bee reference, and is at one point, squished out I don't know how while Kirk rides a vintage motorcycle in circles. And then the squish hardens. I also don't know how, or what that goo was supposed to keep in or out. Much of this is superfluous, but the story was not interesting enough to make me stop looking around. There are way too many wire bundles, a feature of Star Trek Next Gen Borg episodes. When we finally get the Bad Dude's backstory, it isn't enough. Kirk's bored, Bad Dude is disappointed, and how the hell Uhura survives every encounter requires too much suspension of belief. I also noticed that the guys in the theater were sporting ball caps with sunglasses perched on the brim. Noticing fashion in the cinema is not why I go to the movies. Read this week that Chris Hemsworth has signed on to the next Star Trek as George Kirk. Does not bode well for new better adventures."

Reno,"**When theirs rescue mission failed...**

It's not like I'm a big fan of 'Star Wars', so I disliked it. I have seen many space adventure films, but I never felt this series so interesting. I enjoyed some of the 'Star Trek' films though. I know this sequel is not good the previous ones, but for me this look okay than those. Because it was so simple, particularly story wise, and the rest of the film was action and adventure.

No offense, but this series is like the collection of the rejections from other franchises. I mean, look at the cast, most of them are comedians and some of them are the category two actors and the rest are, I don't know what they are, bur decent actors. But these films pulled off successfully at the box office. Not a big impact like the recent 'Star Wars' film or any Marvel's films, but quite an impressive figure knowing the above fact I stated.

From the Taiwanese director who made four 'Fast and Furious' films, handled his best for this. This film tells the story of the captain James Kirk, who leads his ship and crew to a rescue mission to a distant planet where some alien race who had stranded. But when they reach their destination, an unknown space army takes them by surprise and they too take a refuse on the same planet. From there how they plan to escape and to learn who were those attackers, all comes in the next half.

This id full of action adventure. The story was little, but quite neatly developed characters, I mean the new ones with some good stunt sequences. As usual, there's no complaint about the graphics. I mean for the casual viewing, but who knows if you carefully look for the flaws, you might get a few. I suggest you to watch it just for an entertainment, but it might fail to satisfy the die-hard fans of 'Star Trek'. I think overall, it is not a bad film, even the two hours long is not an issue due to the good pace. 

_7/10_"
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"Last Saturday me and the kids sat down to watch Star Trek Beyond which we received in the mail the day before. In general we liked the movie quite a lot. Plenty of action, good special effects and a not too bad story. However, one thing irked me to now end. They blew up the enterprise…again. Stop destroying the bloody Enterprise in every movie for Christ sake! Been there, seen that done that. It is getting both old and frustrating.

Apart from that it was a good entry in the new timeline movie series. I am not sure what all those people giving it one star ratings and calling it the worst movie ever expected to get? Anyone who has watched the two other movies should be expecting a fairly action loaded blockbuster with lots of CGI in it and that is exactly what we got. Personally I think this is a good thing. I was getting rather bored by some of the previous installments in the original timeline where they almost never fired a shot and tried to talk or reason their way out of every problem they encountered.

The story was not too bad although I have to agree that it did not really advance the story or timeline much. It was more like a TV-show episode blown up to a full feature movie. It worked nicely though as a action story although I would have liked to know more about how Edison transformed into Krall and, although that could be explained by some mutation caused by the alien technology, how he managed to transform himself back to Edison.

The CGI with the alien swarm moving fluidly over the screen and the huge Yorktown station was quite stunning as far as I am concerned. I also liked that the ships, both Enterprise and the Franklin could take quite a bit of abuse before starting to fail. In a lot of the previous movies as well as the TV-shows it took one hit and some console exploded and the warp core went down.

All in all both me and the kids quite liked this installment in the series."
lukan87,"I always loved these type  of movies.This one is very adventurous and full of suspans.
Nice one.I've watched it more than 3 times and every time i have the same feeling.
Extraordinary😁!!!!"
Uknown,"A movie about robots and emotions? Pixar has made the unlikely combo work really well.

WALL·E is the lonely robot, the last of his kind, left behind by the humans on Earth. His job - to clean up the garbage the humans have dumped. In 700 years, he seams to have developed one tiny bug - a personality.
Join WALL·E in his interstellar quest to find a partner.

WALL·E is short, satirical, dialogue-free and a visual masterpiece. And the fact that it is animated does not make it any less watchable as an adult.

It is a must watch for anyone of any age."
Kamurai,"A must watch, will watch again, and definitely recommend for everyone, all ages.

The first 30 minutes or so of this movie are pure and perfect magic.  They establish the world, Wall-E, the human race with next to no dialogue.

Wall-E and Eve meeting is wonderfully trip of social anxiety in different personalities and a great metaphor for living together while being different.

Once on the axiom, the entire movie shifts seemlessly, and it is one heavy metaphor after the next about America and the human race without it once being the focus of the story.

If you ever needed a movie that ""does"" and not ""says"", this is your example, it's how world building should be done.

While I think I could literally talk about this movie for hours, I don't want to spoil anything else by talking about it here other than this is a near perfect movie to me.

Watch, enjoy, be well."
r96sk,"Wonderful.

<em>'WALL·E'</em> is beautifully made, despite a relatively simple premise and no real cast to speak of. A big reason for its charm is the strong message and adorable lead characters - WALL·E (Ben Burtt) and EVE (Elissa Knight).

The run time of 98 minutes flies by, with a cool end credits coming at the conclusion. Its animation is utterly superb, while I also like the mix of real-life footage (featuring Fred Willard as Shelby Forthright) into things. Jeff Garlin and Sigourney Weaver work well in their minor roles.

Not at the top of my personal Disney animated productions, but just about inside the top ten up until this point. Lovely film."
mooney240,"**WALL·E is a surprisingly charming story that will warm your heart and make you chuckle.**

WALL·E is a feel-good movie about a robot full of heart and full of love. WALL·E is the Ted Lasso of Pixar characters, puppy dog loyalty and eternally optimistic. WALL·E’s blundering kindness gives hope to so many jaded characters and inspires them to step up and care. WALL·E and EVE are delightful and adorable characters with a story told by an unbelievable screenplay that compels and engages even with such little dialogue. And with a 3-year-old who loves this movie, this parent appreciates the small amount of dialogue, making it more pleasant background noise as my daughter watches it for the 327th time. The animation is superb, and the story is fantastic. WALL·E is one of Pixar’s best in a catalog of masterpieces."
John Chard,"Lee I got a big problem man this guys on steroids! His head is as big as Barry Bonds!

Ah look, as you have most likely heard by now, this is not as good as the first two films and it's just a little bit tired in formula. However, it's still a bunch of fun if you already buy into the fastest mouth/fastest hands pairing of Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan. The plot is incidental, thus simple, and the emphasis here is more on fun than electrifying action. Though the finale here is edge of the seat exciting and laugh inducing in equal measure. There's some truly good one liners thrown out and the chemistry between the two actors is still very much evident.

Undemanding it is for sure, even disposable if it was to be judged as a single action/comedy entry, but it closes the trilogy down safe enough and the smile should rarely leave your face upon viewing. 6.5/10"

angrek,"In 2009 is geoloog Adrian Helmsley op bezoek in India bij een collega en krijgt te horen dat door een grote zonnevlam neutrino's tegenwoordig microgolven afgeven. Daardoor warmt de kern van de aarde met grote snelheid op wat zal leiden tot rampzalige gevolgen voor de planeet. Adrian haast zich terug naar de Verenigde Staten en waarschuwt Anheuser, stafchef van het Witte Huis, die op zijn beurt de president inlicht. Adrian maakt vanaf dan deel uit van de staf van de president en wordt gevraagd een schema te maken van de mogelijke gebeurtenissen die zullen plaatsvinden in de komende jaren.
In 2012 blijkt dat de president opdracht heeft gegeven om 8 grote arken te bouwen waarin 800.000 mensen op basis van DNA, expertise en wetenschap zich schuil zouden kunnen houden. Inmiddels weten ook alle leiders van de meeste landen in de wereld van dit plan af en worden er selecties gemaakt. Ondertussen komt Jackson Curtis in Los Angeles zijn kinderen ophalen bij zijn ex-vrouw Kate (die samenwoont met haar vriend Gordon). Hij neemt z'n kinderen mee naar Yellowstone National Park. Daar worden ze vervolgens meegenomen door het leger en ontmoeten Adrian, die hen de smoes voorlegt dat Yellowstone in moeilijkheden verkeert en daarom geen toeristen toestaat. Ook ontmoeten ze Charlie Frost, die een eigen radiozender heeft en Jackson vertelt dat de wereld binnenkort vergaat. Hij zegt erbij dat er een grote groep mensen is die plaats mag nemen in ""ruimteschepen"" waar hij de locatie van weet. Jackson brengt op verzoek van zijn ex-vrouw zijn kinderen terug naar L.A., alwaar hij hoort dat er een aardbeving heeft plaatsgevonden die een grote scheur in de aarde heeft veroorzaakt. In het Witte Huis wordt duidelijk dat het schema van Adrian sneller verloopt dan ze dachten, en dat door de grote hitte van de aardkern de mantel ook vloeibaarder is geworden, waardoor de aardkorst als het ware ""los"" kan drijven, en dus zal gaan verschuiven. Ook krijgen ze te horen dat er maar 4 arken op tijd klaar zullen zijn. Jackson wordt opgeroepen als chauffeur om de zoons van de Russische miljardair Yuri Karpov op te halen en ze naar het vliegveld te brengen. Hier laat één van de zoons per ongeluk los dat zij de rampen zullen overleven en Jackson niet. Met de informatie die Jackson al van Charlie kreeg, realiseert hij zich dat er inderdaad rampzalige dingen zullen gaan gebeuren, en hij rijdt terug naar L.A. om z'n familie op te halen. Hij gebruikt een vliegtuig en Gordon, die amateurpiloot is, is uiteindelijk gedwongen het vliegtuig te besturen wanneer hun piloot blijkt te zijn omgekomen. Terwijl ze opstijgen is de familie Curtis getuige van de complete verwoesting van Los Angeles. De stad verdwijnt door de aardkorstverschuiving volledig in de Stille Oceaan.
In het Witte Huis wordt Adrian verteld dat de aardkorstverschuiving voor honderden aardbevingen heeft gezorgd en al 2 miljoen slachtoffers heeft geëist. President Wilson geeft het bevel dat zijn personeel zo snel mogelijk het vliegtuig in moet om naar China te vertrekken, waar de ruimteschepen liggen. Hij onthult ook aan Adrian dat hij zelf niet mee zal gaan, omdat iemand de rest van de wereld op de hoogte zal moeten brengen van de komende rampen die tot het einde van de wereld zullen leiden. De president vindt dat hijzelf daar de aangewezen persoon voor is. Adrian gaat vervolgens met Anheuser en andere personeelsleden aan boord van een Air Force One. Jackson beseft intussen dat als ze het willen overleven, ze de locatie van de schepen moeten zien te achterhalen. Hij overtuigt Gordon er daarom van om naar Yellowstone te vliegen en Charlie te vinden, om zo de locatie van de ""ruimteschepen"" te achterhalen. Terwijl Gordon het vliegtuig bijvult met brandstof, gaat Jackson op zoek naar Charlie en vindt hem. Hij vertelt dat de kaart in zijn camper ligt. Jackson weet net op tijd weg te komen als de vulkaan onder Yellowstone plotseling uitbarst. De familie ontsnapt met het vliegtuig net op tijd aan de aswolken. Jackson ontdekt op de kaart dat ze naar China moeten en ze landen uiteindelijk in Las Vegas om nieuwe brandstof te tanken. Hier lopen ze Yuri en z'n gezin tegen het lijf. Hun vliegtuig is gecrasht. Yuri's piloot Sascha neemt vervolgens een oude Antonov An-225 over, maar heeft een co-piloot nodig, waardoor de familie Curtis en Gordon mee kunnen. Ze willen landen in Hawaï om meer brandstof te tanken, maar ontdekken dat Hawaï volledig is veranderd in een vulkanisch gebied. Ze zijn gedwongen verder te vliegen. Sascha voorspelt dat ze binnen 15 minuten in de Stille Oceaan zullen neerstorten. Wanneer hij door de wolken heen is, ziet hij dat waar de oceaan zou moeten zijn, een grote ijsmassa te vinden is. Jackson realiseert zich dat de aardkorstverschuivingstheorie werkelijk bestaat. Ze storten neer op een gletsjer waarbij Sascha omkomt. Vervolgens worden ze gevonden door Chinese troepen, die bezig zijn dieren over te brengen naar de schepen. De soldaten nemen Yuri en z'n kinderen mee wanneer hij zijn tickets laat zien. Daardoor blijven de familie Curtis, Gordon en Yuri's vriendin Tamara (die geen ticket had) achter. In China, bij de schepen, wordt duidelijk dat van één van de arken het dak is ingestort door de aardkorstverschuiving en wordt het Laura en Adrian duidelijk dat de passagiers helemaal niet op basis van DNA en wetenschap zijn gekozen, maar dat rijke mensen hun toegang hebben kunnen kopen: zij hebben per ticket 1 miljard euro neergeteld. Adrian wordt vervolgens door zijn Indiase collega opgebeld met de mededeling dat India op het punt staat overspoeld te worden door een gigantische tsunami. Hierdoor beseft Adrian dat de tsunami hen eerder zal bereiken dan gepland, en dat ze op moeten schieten. Wanneer Anheuser dit hoort, maakt hij de beslissing de poorten van de schepen eerder te sluiten, waardoor tienduizenden mensen, onder wie Yuri en zijn zoons, buitengesloten worden.
Jackson en z'n familie worden intussen opgepikt door een Tibetaanse monnik die op weg is naar de schepen om aan boord te gaan. Ze worden door diens broer aan boord gesmokkeld van een ark via de machinekamer en Jackson beseft dat de schepen geen ruimteschepen maar arken zijn. Ze komen vast te zitten wanneer de poorten weer zakken op bevel van Adrian, die de buitengesloten mensen toch wil binnenlaten. Gordon wordt tussen de tandwielen geslingerd en overlijdt, en tegelijk komt ook een drilboor vast te zitten tussen de motoren, waardoor de poort niet meer volledig kan sluiten. Yuri weet z'n kinderen net op tijd aan boord te krijgen, maar valt vervolgens zelf van het platform en sterft. Nu de poort niet meer volledig sluit, kan de bemanning de motoren niet starten. De tsunami komt al snel hun kant op en water begint de ark binnen te stromen, waarna de passagiers benedendeks door het water waden. Jackson en z'n gezin worden gesplitst doordat waterbestendige deuren sluiten. Daardoor komen zij in verschillende compartimenten terecht. Adrian ziet via de camera's dat Jackson aan boord is weten te komen en haast zich naar de compartimenten om hem en zijn familie te redden. Tamara, die alleen zit, verdrinkt al snel wanneer het water te hoog komt. Jackson hoort van Adrian dat de compartimenten alleen maar open kunnen gaan wanneer de boor uit de motoren wordt gehaald en het hele systeem weer werkt. Met hulp van z'n zoontje Noah weet Jackson dit voor elkaar te krijgen. De poort sluit weer zodat de motoren kunnen worden gestart en een botsing met de Mount Everest ternauwernood wordt voorkomen. Jackson en z'n familie maar ook de monniken worden bevrijd, en Jackson en Kate herenigen zich.
27 dagen later (datum: ""27ste dag van de eerste maand, jaar 0001"") krijgen de arken de eerste satellietfoto binnen, waaruit duidelijk wordt dat Afrika het enige continent is dat niet volledig is overstroomd. Het ligt nu zelfs hoger, waardoor de Drakensbergen nu de hoogste bergen ter wereld zijn. Uit metingen wordt duidelijk dat de lucht weer enigszins schoon is en dat de poorten van de arken kunnen worden geopend. Daardoor kan de mensheid voor het eerst sinds de overstroming weer naar buiten."
John Chard,"And the public gets what the public wants.

Roland Emmerich was armed with a $200 million budget, and this is what it produced. It's an easy film to dislike from an intellectual level, artistically as well, while the science fiction boffins no doubt had kittens where the science was concerned. It's also easily one hour too long in length, and come the second half of the marathon it starts to sag. There's only so many times you can watch your lead protagonists escape crumbling carnage - via various modes of transport - before the fun factor begins to wane. However.

The carnage effects are grade ""A"" stuff, eye popping and ear splintering, Emmerich is a master at this sort of thing, and with a likable cast comfortably chewing through the safe disaster film making screenplay, it's a very decent popcorn blockbuster. It also isn't afraid to explore some dark moments, all of which - while not all being a surprise - strike strong emotional chords. It knows its disaster movie roots and is happy to tug on them.

2012 made a $500 million profit, that's a figure not to be ignored. The blockbuster movie loving public lapped it up, they often love this stuff, they just want to see the world exploding and chases and crashes and humans imploding or being heroic. If you have to strip it bare on any sort of cerebral level, then of course it's naked. But fully clothed, attired purely in modern film popcorn clobber, then it's grand dramatic and exciting fun. And this even as you have to massage your buttocks at the two hour mark. 7/10"
The Movie Diorama,"A Christmas Carol sings the haunted verses of Dickens through disjointed emotionless motion capture. “Bah! Humbug!” Zemeckis had always been fascinated with digital cinema. ‘The Polar Express’ was technological innovation at its more pure, yet ‘Beowulf’ stabbed itself through contrived art direction that failed to suit the dark environment it was showcasing. So when he heard the “House of Mouse” were adapting Dickens’ universally known tale (again...), he clearly joyfully jumped at the chance of producing more digital art. The inevitable question though is: why? Does a Victorian-era Christmas story warrant the unrefined technological advancement of motion capture? Yes and no, is the answer.

The tale itself remains intact, following closer to Dickens’ words than any other adaptation that preceded this. On Christmas Eve, Scrooge encounters various spirits that show the repercussions of his selfish acts, in a bid to rid the evils of ignorance and want. I’ve seen it. You’ve seen it. Your nan has definitely seen it. And probably your pet dog too. Whether it be live-action, Mickey Mouse or The Muppets, you have almost indefinitely seen an adaptation of this famous novella. It’s an important moral that warrants the several iterations over the course of cinema, teaching families the significance of generosity and Christmas spirit.

Much like its source material however, it’s a dark tale. Ghostly ghouls visiting an elderly lonely man, including his deceased business partner entrapped in shackles and the shadow of Sauron succumbing Scrooge to the depths of Mordor’s burning fires. Zemeckis took the core tone of Dickens’ novella and merged it with Disney’s typical holiday whimsicality. The end result? Inconsistent. It’s either too dark for children or too joyous for adults. The two jarring tones rarely worked, producing a conflicting adaptation. One moment Scrooge is dealing with a prostitute dragged away in a straining jacket. The next scene? Children having a snowball fight to the merry notes of Silvestri’s score. Neither producing an entirely cheerful Christmas flick or faithful replication. I’d rather have a 15-rated horror adaptation of A Christmas Carol, as intended of course.

Now for the motion capture. It is what it is I suppose. A technical achievement for its time, utterly outdated a decade later. Character models were stilted. Eyes lacked any expression whatsoever. When close to candle lighting, resembled waxworks. The Ghost of Christmas Past just looked terrible, with its face mismatching the rest of its anthropomorphic candle body. Environmentally speaking, the scenery and inanimate objects were stunningly designed. It really felt like Christmas in Victorian-era London. Just a shame that Zemeckis only tested the limitations of animation through scenes of padding. Scrooge chased by a grim reaper for five minutes. Scrooge flying around London for three minutes. Scrooge slowly becoming Jim Carrey for the film’s entirety. Seemed like additional efforts for gimmicky 3D extravaganza than actual substance.

Fortunately the voice acting was perfect. Carrey and his multitude of personas rarely matched Scrooge’s mundane lifestyle. But that’s why it worked so well! The various voices of the ghosts as well tested his voicing talent remarkably. Oldman as Cratchit added a touch of humility to the story, and again, suited the character perfectly.

A Christmas Carol is a smorgasbord of tonal clashes and technical anomalies. For every fantastic aspect is a tiresome trope. The gorgeous scenery design is counteracted by horrific motion capture. The source material’s darkness is restrained by forced whimsicality in an attempt to appeal to the masses. It’s not the ideal Christmas present I asked for, but I can make do with its contents. Bah! Humbug!"
r96sk,"A tale that almost feels as old as time itself, one that is very much overtold. However, this <em>'A Christmas Carol'</em> is a good retelling of Charles Dickens' work.

Jim Carrey isn't necessarily firing on all cylinders, but is entertaining enough as Scrooge. Gary Oldman (Bob) and Colin Firth (Fred) are welcomed members of the voice cast, also.

I quite like the tone of the film, as well as the design of the animation - which isn't amazing, some parts look like what you'd see in a video game, but it works well to set up the ambience of the London surroundings.

There's good music from Alan Silvestri, too. Overall, I'd recommend it - admittedly I do enjoy the story of Ebenezer a lot."
Reno,"> One liner, somewhat richer, but only a decent entertainer.

A sci-fantasy directed by the Wachowskis of 'The Matrix' fame. Theirs lowest point ever as the filmmakers, but still not that bad flick. The movie lacked in many areas, and one of those is failing to have at least one stunning fight/war scene. I know it was only the beginning and there will be a sequel, maybe ends as a trilogy, but the story was very weak for an intro movie.

Looks like one-liner, precisely to say kind of similar to 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'. I mean in a thin idea, the whole story takes place. Something like a space expedition for a chosen one, hopping from a planet to planet, seeking answers and protection. The title character, Jupiter Jones, played by Mila Kunis, with the help of the Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) takes a risky venture when their lives were threatened. Finding who's behind and other truth brings the end of the narration, which runs for just over a 2 hour.

Performances were okay, but kind of doubt their inclusion in the project. Mostly the cast was the younger ones, maybe except, Sean Bean. Many of them are only the recently emerged stars. So it was a big responsibility in a big budget movie and they did it. But the movie should have had at least one senior artist. The graphics were somewhat rich, and again the absence of the quality scenes and stunts lets the movie fall.

Per Gunnar Jonsson,"It appears that I am going to disagree with a fair number of people when I say that I quite liked this movie. Sure, if you expect some deep story with a lot of moral cleverness in it you are going to be disappointed. This is an interesting story but one that hangs together by a fairly fine thread.

To me it is a decent enough story that is propelled by a decent enough action and absolutely wonderful scenery. Yes, I agree with everyone saying that it is a bit of a B-story. It has many issues and barely hangs together at times.

However, if you try to ignore that for a while and just try to view it as a piece of, fairly fast paced, visual entertainment, well then it hits the spot quite well. It is frequently beautiful to watch. The action sequences are not bad and the story is, if nothing else, certainly not the usual thirteen to a dozen B-movie repeats. The acting is, well, also generally of B-movie quality but it is not downright bad and, once I got in the right mindset for the movie, it did not disturb me.

On the whole I quite liked this movie but I guess you have to be a bit of sci-fi fan, with an emphasize on visuals, to do so."
Reno,"**Yep, this is a different Tarzan, an updated one.**

Recently the Indian jungle boy, the live-action Mowgli film was made and so its time for Africa's. This is not a Disney film and that's one of the disappointments for the Tarzan fans. Because this film is for the grown-ups only. It is rated PG13, but still I don't think the children would enjoy it like they did for the recent 'The Jungle Book' film. So it is like a DC film, I mean, DC makes superhero films for the grown-ups, unlike Marvel's. The bottom line is, don't expect it to be like a Disney film. Like the director said before the release, this is not the Tarzan from your father, grandfather's era, but an updated one with strong graphic violence.

So the story skips all the Tarzan's earlier life like from his childhood to adulthood parts. The film commences with Tarzan being settled in the UK. It's the second half of the 19th century, where the European colonies in the Africa are expanding for its rich natural resources. So in the Congo savanna, the natives welcome Tarzan for his short visit, but the things get ugly when his wife, Jane was kidnapped. Now he must fight back for her safe return and also avert other threats in the region from the foreign power.

There are many CGI character films were made at the recent time, it is a trend, but not all of them are impressive. This film looked average when it comes to vfx. The story was acceptable, the performances were decent, the casting too not bad, but Samuel L. Jackson was completely useless. He's one of the greatest sidekick Hollywood ever produced, but I don't know why he's in this project, his role was very silly.

In other hand, Alexander Skarsgard was good in the lead character and so Margot Robbie as Jane. The action sequences were not good as I expected. The film had a good runtime, but in some parts, it was slow or maybe you can say nothing interesting thing happens. I liked the idea, to update the theme, but they should have given more focus on the story. I hope if they plan another film, it should be a prequel. Because I feel there's lots to learn about the past than going forward. This is a one time watchable film, there's no surprises, just plain and partially entertaining.

_6/10_"
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"This was the most underwhelming Tarzan movie that I have ever seen. A typical product of some Hollywood producer trying to make a ""modern"" take of Tarzan not really knowing or caring for the Tarzan that Edgar Rice Burroughs created. 

In particular it was the palest and most underwhelming Tarzan character yet. He never radiated the strength nor the intelligence that Edgar Rice Burroughs attributed to his character. He spent most of the movie going around with a bland look on his face.

The story itself is pretty much an out of the box standard Hollywood story about slavery and abuse of the black African population. Not truly bad but nothing to write home about either.

There is a lot of CGI in the movie and although quite a few reviewers seem to consider it bad I personally though it was pretty okay. One of the few decent bits of the movie.

I truly do not understand that they had the nerve to call this movie The Legend of Tarzan since it really is pretty far from the legend of Tarzan that Edgar Rice Burroughs created. This movie would perhaps have been okay as a one hour episode in a Tarzan TV-show but as a high budget feature movie it simply does not cut it. I was quite disappointed."
r96sk,"Long bloody title, but a great film no doubt.

I had seen <em>'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'</em> before but hadn't watched it for years and years, I remembered the vast majority though - it's a memorable film after all. There's a great battle scene in there, some fun characters and strong effects. It's a tad too long, but not by much.

It has a nice charm to it also, as they set up Narnia excellently. The quartet of children are very well cast, all four of them suit their roles to a T. Georgie Henley is sweet as Lucy, while William Moseley and Anna Popplewell fulfil the roles of Peter and Susan comfortably. Edmund, meanwhile, is of course annoying, but Skandar Keynes does a good job portraying him.

Elsewhere, Tilda Swinton and Liam Neeson are terrific casts as the White Witch and Aslan. Both do great, especially Swinton. James McAvoy, Ray Winstone, Michael Madsen and Rupert Everett are smart choices too.

I've, as far as I'm aware, never seen the two sequels so very much look forward to seeing what they have in store for me. They'll do well to match this first film, that's for sure."
Austin Singleton,"Not really a step forward in the X-Men franchise. Read my full review here.

http://www.hweird1reviews.com/allreviews/x-men-apocalypse-review"
Gimly,"Though far from the worst _X-Men_ film, _Apocalypse_ was still a disappointment, because until this entry, every Bryan Singer _X-Men_ film had been excellent. _Apocalypse_ is a far cry from terrible, but it is underwhelming given Singer's history, as well as in and of itself.

Certain actors, who shall remain Jennifer Lawrence, were completely checked out in this instalment. The CGI was often so bad it was confronting, even in the climax of the film. Apocalypse's plan was plot-hole-y and underdeveloped, and not all of the new characters hit it out of the park.

There was still a lot to like here though. Some of the newer costumes were neat, and a lot of the side-plots had me very intrigued. Fassbender and McAvoy are excellent as always. It's certainly not a failure amongst the likes of, for example, _X-Men: The Last Stand_. Which was a good callout in _Apocalypse_. Another thing I enjoyed.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
Reno,"**Another ancient power was awoken and blah blah blah.**

I have seen almost all the superhero films of the recent time, but this is the franchise I never liked. I'm sorry to say that, but that's the truth. The 'X-Men' series never made me sense, particularly to say it from the Marvel comics is a disappointment. When it comes to 'Wolverine', my opinion is different, because I loved those films. Hugh Jackman as Logan is the only 'X-Men' I love, so like usual this is another waste of time from its series to me.

I even enjoyed the recently rebooted 'Fantastic Four', but not this one. There's nothing new in the story, it's the same plot stolen from the different films. Like an ancient force is awoken who tries to rule the world by destroying everything created so far by the humans. So the mutants join hands to bring him down and we know what happens at the end. Apart from the vfx, this is very boring film and 150 minutes runtime was another lengthy joke that you never laugh.

Not just me, many people, even 'X-Men' fans showed displeasure over this film. That means, Bryan Singer's stint with the franchise is pretty much over. So they will going to bring a new one and that's another disappointment, because I don't know how long they're going to drag this series. End it already. Anyway, like I said I never was or will be this universe fan, so I don't care much, rather I just give them a try when they get released and obviously I'm to end in regret watching. Instead, I'm looking forward to the final 'Wolverine' film with Hugh Jackman.

Per Gunnar Jonsson,"X-Men Apocalypse is typical of what you would expect from a Marvel X-Men movie. Light on story and depth and heavy on special effects and action. In short it is exactly what I, as a Science Fiction and Fantasy geek, would expect as well as hope for.

The X-Men faces a new threat in the form of the worlds first mutant. Naturally said mutant is really a Übermutant vastly more powerful than any “normal” mutant. Equally naturally this Übermutant is set on a path of world destruction and domination. I quite liked this villain. He is a good all evil and powerful bad guy and a worthy adversary. No nonsense about trying to make the villain likable or trying to explain why he turned evil or such like. This guy is evil, he is the bad guy, he needs to be taken down…full stop.

As I wrote the story is not the most elaborate one around but it is a good one within the confines of a Marvel super hero movie. It gets the job done without being overly stupid or silly. It is set in the “prequel” universe created by X-Men First Class. The movie adds a few new X-Men to the ranks of Professor Xaviers team. Some of them thanks to the manipulations of Apocalypse although they start out on the bad side at first.

The movie moves along at a decent enough pace and, as was mentioned, there are quite a few action sequences and special effects thrown at the viewer throughout the movie. Personally I found the special effects to be quite good. Even stunning at times. I am quite a bit of a special effects nerd so of course this pleased me a lot.

The movies ending certainly opens the door to future X-Men movies and I for sure would like to see the franchise continue. I very much enjoyed these almost two and a half hours in front of my TV set."
in_the_crease,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

After immensely enjoying the turn the X-Men franchise took after the disappointment of X-Men: The Last Stand, I was pretty excited to see this movie. I love comics, but I never got into the X-Men, so I can excuse some of the inaccuracies that seemed to upset hardcore fans. I just enjoyed the movies.

X-Men Apocalypse is the weakest film since duds like Last Stand and Wolverine Origins. It just didn't have a whole lot going on. One of the biggest critiques of Marvel (yes, I know X-Men films aren't produced by Marvel Studios, but I'm speaking of the publisher of the original medium) is that their villains are lackluster. The big baddie through the whole franchise has been Magneto, easily the most charismatic and entertaining Marvel villain on film. Though we've had brushes with Stryker and Trask and his sentinels, this is the first movie in which the X-Men had taken on a true super villain who wasn't Magneto-- Wolverine vs. The Silver Samurai aside. 

But it's almost like director Bryan Singer painted himself into a corner with Apocalypse. The villain was too powerful and could have easily achieved his goals without the help of his ""four horsemen."" He could have ended the world, in mere minutes, all by himself. But, of course, that would make a boring movie, so Singer and Co. had to figure out what to do with the world's most powerful and dangerous mutant for two hours before the final climax was to begin.

There were scenes where the villains were literally sitting around the desert talking about how they were going to lay waste to a city on the horizon. There were scenes where the most powerful of the villains went out recruiting much less powerful villains to join him. Really, Singer just didn't know what to do with this character. How do you create conflict and drama when the bad guy is just too powerful? Well, you can't. 

Of course, after two hours of watching the most powerful mutant ever talk about what he is going to do (instead of simply doing it) he finally unleashes his fury. Except that, the X- Men actually have the most powerful mutant in the world on their side in Jean Grey.

So, again, why is Jean not simply destroying Apocalypse in the first 10 minutes of the movie? Because, running time needs filler.

And that's basically what this movie is: Filler. They came up with a concept that would make the storytelling aspect problematic. And rather than tweaking the concept or fleshing out the story with subplots, they just assumed explosions and superhero fights would be enough to carry the film."
Movie Queen41,"What a let down after Days of Future Past (the best X-Men movie ever, in my opinion). Bryan Singer has usually directed some of the best films of the franchise but this one is a real clunker. Too many characters with not enough development and a very lackluster villain. Oscar Isaac is a talented actor, but even he can't make Apocalypse interesting under all that silly blue make up. Characters like Angel and Psylocke, as Apocalypse's horsemen, are very thinly written and barely have a personality. Also, it is absolutely ridiculous that the villain Mystique is transformed into a role model and leader for the X-Men in this movie. Jennifer Lawrence looks bored throughout and barely appears as Mystique's true blue self even though she's supposed to be an out and proud mutant. A real disappointment."
Wuchak,"***Ranks with the best in the X-Men franchise***  

Released in 2016 and directed/co-written by Bryan Singer, ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" has the team go up against the first mutant, Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac), whose origins date back to ancient Egypt. After thousands of years in stasis, Apocalypse is immediately disillusioned by the state of the world and so recruits a team of worthy mutants, including a dispirited Magneto (Michael Fassbender), to purge humanity and craft a new world order over which he will reign. Professor X (James McAvoy), with the assistance of Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), leads a team of young X-Men to stop their greatest nemesis and save mankind from complete destruction. Josh Helman is on hand as Col. Stryker.

This sixth film in the franchise (not including the several spin off films) easily ranks as one of the best. It includes many of the best elements of the X-Men and everything I would want in a great X-Men flick:

Professor X's ongoing goal for an educational sanctuary for interesting mutants from all over the world; his love for Moira (Rose Byrne); Magneto's increasing mastery of his great powers and his struggle to go on the offensive against prejudiced humanity; a greater focus on Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) and his potent power, both of which were neglected in the original trilogy; an outstanding actress to play Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), who is far better than the bland Famke Janssen; Olivia Munn's ultra-hotness as Psylocke; a worthy subplot on Weapon X with the corresponding guest appearance of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman); an excellent collection of young mutants, like Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Beast (Nicholas Hoult), Quicksilver (Evan Peters), Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee), Havok (Lucas Till), Angel (Ben Hardy), etc.; a worthy main villain in the mold of Dr. Doom and Thanatos; an epic, apocalyptic final act (sorry); I could go on and on.

This isn't to say the movie doesn't have faults, however; the cartoony overblown prologue in ancient Egypt is Exhibit A.

The film runs 144 minutes and was shot in Quebec, Canada (Greenfield Park, Montreal and Oka).

GRADE: A-"
Myles,"Plenty of action with good acting, however, Apocalypse (the villain) lacks originality. X-Men: Apocalypse is a mediocre film in the respected franchise that is ""X-Men"""
tricksy,Excellent movie. Best of the trilogy. Lovely music. Nolan is a genius. So is Heath Ledger.
talisencrw,"This has no competition. It is the very finest comic-book character movie ever made. Knowing the Burton, Donner and Nolan filmic adaptations of Batman and Superman exist helps me to sleep at night. They are Exhibit A of 'How to Make a Comic-Book Movie'. Nothing else has ever come even remotely close. These seven films (I include 'Superman II' because it was mostly Donner's work)--and Nolan's trilogy especially--are what I imagine a great director like Kubrick, Hitchcock or Kurosawa would have come up with, if they had ever been asked to make a Superman or Batman movie. They are the easiest for an audience to identify with because in these the scripts most approximate human emotions and the typical conundrums of the human experience--in short, are the closest, in a good way, they come to the complexities of the human condition. Peerless."
erickprieto,"Perhaps the best Batman movie of all times. I think that this Batman trilogy presents the well-known superhero history in an unexpected way with the capable to maintain on the edge of the chair all time.
**Heath Ledger** present an excellent impersonification of a psychopath.

And Bruce Wayne role played by Christian Bale, shows a human being behind of the mask."
moubledian,"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".

Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.

Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.

Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?

Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.

Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.

""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars.

Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.

""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars."
tmdb22590444,"One of the best movies of all time. Christopher Nolan has brought us the Batman trilogy that it made it feel it could happen today. Christian Bale returns as Batman, was able to perform as wonderfully as he did in Batman Begins. The one person that ultimately stole the show had to be the late Heath Ledger who played as the Joker. His performance as a psychotic clown terrorizing Gotham City was one of the best performance as a superhero villain. One of the best parts of the Joker was when he was telling his victims on how “he got his scars?”. Another great part was when he kidnapped a police officer and he was recording it while scaring the man and also giving a warning to Batman. The supporting actor and actresses did a good job of delivering the story. I was disappointed that Katie Holmes did not return as Rachael Dawes but the actress how played as her Maggie Gyllenhaal did a really good job. One of the best parts of Christopher Nolan is that in every movie of his, the cinematography would look amazing and this movie is no exception."
tmdb79614358,"A Masterpiece!!! I Love how The Dark Knight shows to me the ""Dark & Gritty Tone"". Overall, Nolan give us the Game changing, best superhero film OF ALL TIME. For me it's 10/10"
EDSR,"A sickening, borderline fascist film that is simultaneously dull and harmful. The editing represents that of an anti-pirate commercial and the politics are beyond reprehensible. The film ends with a monologue about how violent law-enforcement and brutality is what the country needs, but does not deserve. Nolan clearly did not intend for any subtext, yet that is not an excuse, if anything, that makes it worse. He includes these scenes to make the film more dark and edgy, yet there are people, from suppressed countries, who have to live through the hardships of violence from law-enforcers and dictatorship every day, and in his obliviousness, Nolan thinks that using this in a superhero film is a good excuse for self-importance. He is a war profiteer, and exploiter, and this is nothing short of disgusting."
AstroNoud,"Unforgettable crime film with good dialogue, thrilling action and chase scenes and once again a magnificent cast (most notably a terrifically terrifying Ledger) and superb score.

CinemaSerf,"Heath Ledger is outstanding in this follow up to the 2006 ""Batman Begins"" outing for the caped crusader. His portrayal of the malevolent ""Joker' is confident and highly entertaining, treading a fine line between supreme intellect and total insanity with considerable aplomb. He comes back to terrorise ""Gotham"" after ""Batman"" (Christian Bale), ""Gordon"" (Gary Oldman) - now Commissioner in charge of the police force, and newly installed District Attorney ""Dent"" (Aaron Eckhart) had made progress getting the criminals off the street. The ""Joker"", meantime, decides that the best strategy is to rob the mob - and pitching them all against each other, and with the help of the duplicitous ""Lau"" (Chin Han) manages to secure enough of their funds to initiate a campaign of lawlessness that is ruthless, manipulative and good fun to watch. Not only has the man in black his new, potent, nemesis to deal with - but he also begins to realise that his childhood sweetheart ""Rachel"" (this time Maggie Gyllenhaal) is drifting into the arms of the new DA. it is also pretty clear that they are both now proving to be an useful additional weapon in the armoury of his enemy who knows, increasingly, which buttons to press to cause maximum anxiety among those who would bring him down. It's over 2½ hours long, but really does fly by as the quickly paced action really does kick in right from the start. The story is dark and gritty but the pace isn't ponderous and moody - Ledger exudes a sense of peril throughout the whole thing, but that has an edge to it - a sophistication that plays well against the flawed superhero who is increasingly having to identify and cope with his own demons. Sir Michael Caine pops up now and again as his shrewd butler ""Alfred"", always striving to keep his boss on the right side of sanity, and Morgan Freeman continues to feature (sparingly) and his quartermaster. On that latter front, there are loads of new gadgets that still have that element of plausibility to them (no super-powers!). On balance I think I still preferred the first film, but as sequels go - this takes, and will take, some beating. On a big screen in a packed cinema, it's just a great experience."
mooney240,"**Overall : A cinematic marvel and once-in-a-decade masterpiece.**

This isn't simply a superhero movie or a Christopher Nolan film. The Dark Knight is a masterpiece. A perfect film. An epic scale with magnificent action pieces, oscar-winning performances, incredible writing, excellent pacing, dazzling special effects, and the list goes on and on, including the set design, costumes, and more. But, Christopher Nolan did more than make the greatest superhero movie of all time. He made one of the greatest movies of all time! All this is elevated further by Heath Ledger's once-in-a-lifetime portrayal of the Joker. Ledger was born for this role with a performance in league with Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter or Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday."
r96sk,"A fun and charming adventure.

<em>'Up'</em> certainly knows how to tug at the heartstrings. It creates a very meaningful story around Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner), with the early scenes particularly standing out as superb.

I don't overly enjoy the parts with Dug (Bob Peterson) and Kevin (Pete Docter), not that they are bad, though everything with Fredricksen, Russell (Jordan Nagai) and Charles F. Muntz (Christopher Plummer) is entertaining and/or hearty.

Asner and Nagai do terrific, in what is one of Disney's 'best of the rest' films. There is some lovely music by Michael Giacchino, too. Go watch!"
Peter89Spencer,"To Christopher Plummer and Ed Asner...

RIP."
izgzhen,"Imaginative illustration of an epic story. It combines the modern background society, e.g. terrorism, with the unconventional high-tech fantasy. Our leading actor Robert Downey Jr. deeply embodies the soul of the Iron Man in himself. We common people never lived this way :P"
Gimly,"**A long form review originally posted in 2010:**

Marking the beginning of the latest Marvel franchise, _The Avengers_, is Jon Favreau's _Iron Man_.

I'm quite fond of Super Hero movies, I don't love them to the same extent that I do the slasher or psychological thriller genres, but they do hold a small place in my heart all to themselves. I'm pretty pumped for this whole ""Avengers"" thing to come to fruition, 'cause honestly it's all been great so far, starting with Iron Man, whom Robert Downey Jr. (_Natural Born Killers, Gothika, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, A Scanner Darkly, Zodiac, Sherlock Holmes, Due Date_) portrays, and incredibly so.

It's important to set yourself a starting point. More specifically, what I mean is, a reason. Batman's parents were murdered, and his home was destroyedby crime; The Punisher's whole family was murdered in front of him and he big-time snapped; characters like the X-Men and the Fantastic 4 are defending themselves and end up having a penchant for world-saving. Those are all fine, and so long as you have one, I'm happy. But I really kind of like Tony Stark's reason for becoming Iron Man... He's a dick. That's why. He's a dick that supplies the world with the most lethal weapons in existence, and they take lives left, right and centre. Then, he's put through the world where they get used, and finally is told by the person who helped him escape that world, not to waste his life. He believes he is still alive for a reason, he decides that reason is to become a dick that is intent on privatising world peace. Which I think makes perfect sense.

That may have come across as sarcasm, but I was deadly serious. Tony Stark becomes Iron man, and that's why. It works fantastically. We then get to see all the incarnations of his suit, how difficult it was to make, what it runs on, the technology, everything. And I'm a huge fan of back story, which Iron Man delivers.

It's sort of the antithesis of DC's _Batman Begins_. Though they're both young adults that come from money with no family, a British butler (although Iron man's butler Jarvis was transformed into AI for the film [he was an actual person in the comics]), they have a board of directors take care of their family's billionaire business until they're ready to eventually take the reins, they both become ""____ Man"" and go about saving the innocent, not through superpowers but technology. I'm sure I could go on. But they're also incredibly different. Where Batman is a total bad ass, the gothic unknown defender of the night that uses fear as a weapon to protect his home town, and yet refuses to kill; Iron Man is a bright, shiny, loud attention grabber, who goes all international to fight crime, he wants the world to know he's Iron Man and his enemies are totally lame, so no wonder he has no qualms about killing! Batman's secret identity, Bruce Wayne, is an angsty tosser, that tries way to hard. But Tony Stark, is a witty, brilliant inventor, who has basically harnessed all of Batman's training, strength, weapons, vehicles and flight, improved them, and put them in to a single suit. So though I personally prefer Batman as a hero, I prefer Tony Stark as a character.

The interaction between Stark and Pepper Potts, played by Gwyneth Paltrow (_Se7en, The Talented Mr. Ripley, The Royal Tenenbaums, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow_) was incredible. It just goes to show what good casting can achieve, even in an action flick, the dialogue is hilarious and clever. Is it possible for a Super Hero movie to be a bad Super Hero film but a great film? I guess it is.

The antagonists are lacking to say the least, and their dispatching leaves even more to be desired. Which is normally not too huge when you get the rest so perfect, unfortunately, it's a comic book film, about Super Heroes, and Super Villains. They fight one another over and over, in fact that's pretty much what the comics are about in their entirety, so it's quite a major short coming. That being said, it's really the only one that _Iron Man_ has. In a way though, they're a similar comparison to the latest Batman films again; Iron Monger and Whiplash are flashy, but disappointing, where The Joker, Two-Face, Scarecrow and Ra's al Ghul are top notch as bad guys. Whereas Ironman's Obadiah Stane and Ivan Vanko were great characters, but Batman's The Joker is only seen in his villain persona, and Harvey Dent, Jonathan Crane and Henri Ducard are nothing more than vessels for their alter-egos.

All that aside, the film is just plain good, and you don't need to be a fan of Iron Man, Super Heroes or comics in general to enjoy _Iron Man_.

tmdb44006625,"Iron Man did a lot more than just launch the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was the first comic book movie in a long time to integrate the fantastical nature of superheroes and supervillains into a real world setting with consequences. It also showed how great of a filmmaker Jon Favreau is and rebooted the career of Robert Downey Jr.

For all this, Iron Man is a fantastic movie, still one of the best MCU films. It's so much fun to watch. Yet it displays a lot of intelligence, exploring the internal dilemma of a man profiteering off war when faced with the harsh reality that he is part of a system that corrupts absolutely."
The Peruvian Post,"When director Jon Favreau and Sarah Halley cast Robert Downey Jr, they glimpsed something magnificent: a more-than-skilled actor who faultlessly portrayed the role of Tony Stark. Despite Favreau's initial decision in choosing a fresh face, he ended up delighted due to his charismatic, natural and comfortable attitude. He did not realise it yet, but he was moulding with the right measures a whole superhero cinematic universe which lasted until today and still goes for more.

The filmmakers took the proper time to introduce a character whose production was undecided since New Line Pictures argued that the main character [Iron Man] had no potential to be brought up to the theatres. Therefore, planning from scratch a prosperous superhero who was not related to the typical Fantastic Four, X-Men or Spider-Man [famous superhero films of the 2000s] was quite a challenge. However, the director unquestionably demonstrated his skills at the visual effects, the rock metal music, the accurate dialogues for each moment and finally, the remarkable development of each persona. How exactly?

Establishing the visual effects of a high-speed-altitude enthusiast was marvellous, considering the time of the creation. The way Favreau adjusted the Iron Man gave numerous innovative perspectives of a superhero while in battle. If we first watched the 'Spidey Sense', then it was time to behold the flying upper and upper. What an achievement ladies and gentleman! Taking into account the sound effect, it was splendid in every single way because it gave decent time to evoke emotions, from sadness to awesomeness, it permitted to feel the sensation of building a strong armour or flying as fast as possible. 

Man! That AC/DC hard rock music was well-defined to this fascinating character. Did I mention that Downey's son is growing on music? He has a band, and it's called ""The Dose Band"". Just watch the School of Rock's report. Probably there is where the influence came by. On the other hand, this film gives such iconic quotes which will live on our memory: ""Is it better to be feared or respected?"", ""Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk"", ""I am Iron Man"". WOW! What potential we have got here! Finally, but not least, the impeccable action scenes and drama ones were the highest achieves Iron Man had got. The sequence in the cavern traped with Dr Yinsen serves to the protagonist time to reflect on himself and the responsibility he has in protecting the world against high-tech diseases.

Plus, the very unusual but gorgeous chemistry between Tony Stark and his secretary/companion Pepper Potts is another striking feature which is not considered at all was. When Kevin Feige, the current president of Marvel Studios, was asked about his desition about casting Gwyneth Paltrow he confessed the following: ""Gwyneth is the embodiment of a leading lady. She brings intelligence, poise and an incredible range of talent to this role"". Throughout the movie, these two characters happened to be facing their professional and sentimental relationship naturally owing to the Iron Man. The way Pepper Potts clings on to the fact that his beloved boss is in troublesome scenarios, it's just pure tenderness and shows how much potential this couple has.

The cast assuredly introduced not only convincing performances but strong characters which will be handy for the following Marvel instalments, just watching Jeff Bridges as the badass Iron Monger is superb! The film producer nailed it! If someone asked me about the flaws it has presented, probably I would say the dark tone, some petit explicit scenes (bearing in mind there are children as spectators) and the lack of sense of humour at times. Still, it is mostly pure perfection.

r96sk,"My first taste of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A great start!

I absolutely enjoyed seeing <em>'Iron Man'</em>. Robert Downey Jr. is terrific as the titular character, who is a blast to watch throughout - love the design! The plot is very entertaining, I like how it tells the story; simply, but very effectively. Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow, meanwhile, all add to the film with good performances.

The special effects are very neat, as are all the action sequences. I will say the score isn't the strongest, at least in terms of what I'd expect from this sorta film. I wouldn't say it's bad per se, just not as spectacular as it could've (should've?) been; especially with someone like Ramin Djawadi composing. I love a film with great music, so hopefully that improves as I watch the MCU expand.

I know, I'm extremely late to this particularly party but happy to finally begin watching."
Filipe Manuel Dias Neto,"**An excellent film, which only loses a little in some details related to the writing of the script and the conception of some characters.**

I'm not a fan of superhero movies, but like any movie fan in general, I've seen a good handful of them. This was the first film made by Marvel and financed by the company itself, and it brings us one of its most acclaimed heroes. The film shows how a young playboy millionaire named Tony Stark, with a fortune inherited from his father and largely made from the production and sale of weapons, becomes a vigilante determined not to allow the misuse of the weapons he sells. I don't know much about comics, but I believe that the film was limited to adapting to the cinema a story already written on paper about the origins of the character, giving it, perhaps, a touch of the present.

The plot is one of the strongest points of the film, not only for the way it introduces the character in the context of the current geopolitical conflicts (with the Middle East issue very present), but mainly for the way it transforms Tony Stark into a deeper character, who lives a catharsis that opens his conscience to questions that he was not sensitive enough to understand. Put more simply, if initially Stark was a rich and spoiled idiot, he ends the movie with another awareness of what he should do and how his attitudes influence the world around him. However, I also felt that once Stark realizes what he has to do, and it becomes clear who the enemy is to defeat, the script quickly loses quality and becomes much more basic and underdeveloped.

With a skillful direction provided by Jon Favreau, the cast gave us a very good performance. Of course, the public's attention is focused on Robert Downey Jr., an actor who started working in the 80s, but only began to emerge at the turn of the millennium, with some productions (*Gothika*, *Good Night and Good Luck*, *Zodiac*) that he entered before accepting Marvel's proposal. He is perfect in character and gives us his life's work as an actor. Beside him, we can still admire Gwynneth Paltrow, in a more discreet but competent role. The villain was secured by Jeff Bridges, but his work is not so well executed and the actor sometimes doesn't seem to know exactly how to behave in the character.

What can we say about the production values ​​and technical quality of a movie with a millionaire budget of 140 million dollars? It is a film determined to be a blockbuster, which fully achieved all its objectives, earning high profits, pleasing the fans and achieving high praise from the general public and the specialized critics. And the money invested is in plain sight, with a declared bet on very high quality CGI, wonderfully well-executed sound and image effects and really good sets and costumes (with great emphasis - obviously - on Iron Man's suit and Stark's mansion). The cinematography is excellent, the filming work was really well done, and the editing was detailed, giving the film a pleasant rhythm that doesn't tire us out. Finally, a note of praise for the excellent and epic soundtrack."
Kamurai,"Really good watch, might watch again, and can recommend.

Asa Butterfield, Chloe Grace-Moretz, Ben Kingsley, and Sacha Baron Cohen all give a great performance in this weird, weird setting of an alt history train station, or hell, maybe this is a true story and I'm just that unfamiliar with the birth of cinema.

There is a great message of love and togetherness in this, but it's told in such an odd way.  It's very refreshing, but a family movie from the point of view of an orphan is untraditional, and then there is all this theming of mechanics and along with weird dreams.  Despite all the artsy fartsy nonsense, the experience and story are both fun and charming.

As long as you have an open mind, I'm sure this will be a fun watch."
John Chard,"Steampunk Blockbusterdom!

Barry Sonnenfeld's Wild Wild West is a film that I have avoided for over 15 years. I have no frame of reference with the source materials, but even though I'm a big Westerns fan, it wasn't this, or the critical pounding it got on release, that kept me away. It was the original trailers for it, it just looked like a garbled over budgeted mess - which it kinda is. 

However, that's not to say there isn't fun to be had, because for all its many failings (poor effects, poor script, waste of a strong cast, superficiality), there is some verve and swagger, excitement, Will Smith's likability and some splendid gadgets. Having very low expectations no doubt helped me out, but I would hardly call this a 1/10 type of film. I say chill out with a beer, turn the home cinema speakers up and just roll with it, because thinking about it too deeply could possibly make you angry... 5/10"
r96sk,"I felt entertained by this.

It is a very bonkers film, though it actually works stupidly well in my opinion - the steampunk theme helps it of course. Will Smith and Kevin Kline are a good pairing as West and Gordon. Kenneth Branagh (Arliss) is amusing, I rate his character's design too.

I will say the effects around Smith and Kline haven't aged gracefully, but for everything else around them it still looks quite nice. I enjoyed the train shenanigans in particular. Salma Hayek (Rita) is kinda pointless in this, she's basically just there for gratuitous sexual reasons.

The film does also try to cram in an (obviously positive) message regarding racists and the such, which doesn't really fit and isn't as developed as could've been. <em>'Wild Wild West'</em> is at its best when it's being amusing.

A brainless watch. I'd, personally, recommend it - though a lot of people would evidently disagree with me."
Peter89Spencer,"THE GOOD:
1) It's funny
2) Got good action
3) The music video is awesome
4) It stars Will Smith and Kevin Kline

THE BAD:
1) It didn't live up to the original series
2) Over the top storyline
3) I hate spiders!

1) This rating right here!"
Gimly,"From dumb fun to... regular dumb.

It's hard to find a point where _Tomb of the Dragon Emperor_ wasn't hampered by itself. Or a point where it makes any sort of logical sense. Unfortunate that is was no good, lending credence to the need of a reboot, which we now have, but wish we didn't.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid if possible._"
John Chard,"Not the same Mummy twice, nor thrice for that matter.

Well it's been pretty much universally panned has this third Brendan Fraser led instalment of the new age Mummy series. So lets not beat around the bush here, it's not very good, but it's hardly deserving of the 1/10 ratings it has been given by amateur on line reviewers.

The plot (for what it's worth) sees young Alex O'Connell, now amazingly a grown man in a short space of time, unearth evil old Chinese Emperor Han and his accursed Terracotta Army. Naturally some bonehead is going to bring him back from the dead, and naturally the now retired O'Connell's are forced back into their Mummy fighting ways. Can Rick, Evelyn and poor Jonathan save the day? Will Alex prove his credentials as the offspring of such daring-do parents? Will anybody care come the finale? 

Rachael Weisz has (wisely) bailed and into her shoes comes a woeful Maria Bello, with fluctuating accents and zero chemistry with her leading man, Bello has undone the promise shown in World Trade Center & A History Of Violence. Steer clear of action movies dear. Fraser looks bored and can barely muster the energy to deliver the now tired and stilted lines. He admitted once that The Mummy 2 was basically a cheeky remake of the first film, quite what he has to say about this one I await with much interest. John Hannah is merely a bystander and it's probably the easiest money he will ever earn, an utter waste it be. Luke Ford does OK as Alex and Michelle Yeoh, Jet Li (the Emperor) & the beautiful Isabella Leong make do with what the unimaginative script gives them to do.

What saves the film from being a bottom of the barrel feeder is the action quota. Even though the spectre of poor CGI hangs around every corner, the sequences come thick and fast and they at least keep the blood pumping, thus stopping the audience themselves from drifting into a centuries long sleep. There's some good gags too (you will yearn for more of Liam Cunningham), while the choreography for the fights involving the Asian stars is not to be sniffed at. Stephen Sommers left the directors chair for this one, handing over to Rob Cohen, which explains why the film is more concerned with action accelerate over substance. But Sommers, who gave us a genuine genre delight with the first film, has a writing credit and was on production duties for this effort. I trust he now feels saddened by what his franchise has now become. 4/10"
Wuchak,"***High adventure in China, albeit totally overdone***

In 1946 Rick & Evy (Brendan Fraser & Maria Bello) are bored in their middle age in England and so take an assignment to China where they meet Evelyn's brother (John Hannah) and their son (Luke Ford) who has discovered the tomb of a tyrannical ancient emperor (Jet Li). Unfortunately, there’s a secret plot to resurrect the mummified remains of the Emperor and all hell naturally breaks loose. Michelle Yeoh and Isabella Leong are also on hand.

""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" (2008) is an overblown action/adventure horror/comedy popcorn blockbuster, just like the first two flicks. It's not as good as “The Mummy” (1999), yet it's better than the unabsorbing “The Mummy Returns” (2001). Yes, it's overdone like the second one, but the story is more compelling.

While it's regrettable that Rachel Weisz opted out of this third film in order to be with her one year-old son, Maria Bello is a solid replacement and actually looks better in tight pants (as she's curvier and therefore more physically appealing).

Of course the film’s preposterous in the tradition of the previous two and the Indiana Jones flicks. But let's give credit where credit is due: “Tomb of the Dragon Emperor” bends over backwards to entertain with tombs, priceless artifacts, mummies, Shanghai, the Great Wall, the Himalayas, yetis, Shangri-La, zombies, a three-headed dragon and martial arts.  

If you can get past the absence of Weisz and embrace Bello (which, let’s face it, isn’t that hard to do), this is easily the second best of the trilogy. Interestingly, Roger Ebert maintained that it was the best and he ain't no slouch when it comes to appraising pictures, whatever the genre. Yet my wife zeroed-in on the film’s flaw, which is the same as the previous flick: It tries too hard. It frantically throws in everything but the kitchen sink and is the lesser for it. (Yetis, seriously?)

The movie runs 1 hour, 52 minutes, and was shot in Buckinghamshire, England; Montréal, Québec; and China (Beijing, Shanghai, Inner Mongolia, Tianmo, Heng Dian, Dongguan & Terracotta Warriors Museum, Xi'an, Shaanxi).  

GRADE: B-"
Frank Ochieng,"Summertime 2016 has not been very kind to DC Comics-based personalities looking to shine consistently like their big screen Marvel Comics counterparts. Following the super-sized dud that was _Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice_ released a few months ago must really put some major pressure on Warner Bros. to gamble on ensuring that the presence of **Suicide Squad** does not meet the same kind of indifferent reception. Well, it turns out that although the anticipation was high for writer-director David Ayer's supervillain saga involving high-powered imprisoned rogues recruited as U.S. governmental operatives out to stop other skillful baddies (as it was for Zack Ryder's aforementioned ""Dawn of Justice"") the concoction of **Suicide Squad** feels like a colorful mishmash of collective misfits laboriously taking up space in a disjointed eye candy-coated spectacle that never manages to match its intended sizzle.

One would think that the premise for **Suicide Squad** would tap into the intriguing naughtiness with more robust gumption given the collection of super-powered oddballs asked to be immediate anti-heroes in this toothless jamboree of renegade rejects. Strangely, the grim and brooding presentation of **Suicide Squad** is more of an erratic downer than a hyperactive high-wire act as intended at the creative hands of Ayer. There is no reason why this lively group of adventurous agitators should appear so flat and inconsequential in a boisterous blockbuster that sporadically limps.

Given the twisted members that comprise this elite team of terrorizing tools it is very disappointing to see how **Suicide Squad** struggles with its so-called subversive themes. Sadly, this splattered mess never firmly grasps its bid for distinctive irreverence or off-balance exploitation. Instead, **Squad** feels strained in its execution and we are never really invested in entirely watching these treasured troublemakers find redemption because the story is soggy and uninspired. Furthermore, not all of the **Squad** participants are fleshed out satisfyingly for us to get behind with thirsty cynicism. The headlining leads in Will Smith's Floyd Lawton/Deadshot, Oscar-winner Jared Leto's green-haired Joker and Australian beauty Margot Robbie's Harleen Quinzel/Harley Quinn get the meaty standout parts while the lesser known supporting cast get stuck with chewing on the thankless remaining bone while seemingly acting as background furniture to the bigger names.

Naturally, desperation has set in for the U.S. government as they need to safeguard national security against advanced sinister forces that threaten the fiber of American self-interests everywhere. What better way to hire gifted protection than to consider employing the world's most incarcerated corruptible, cutthroat cretins to perform the dirty work in unforgivable mission ops that require death-defying determination. Enter U.S. Intelligence agent Amanda Waller (Oscar nominee Viola Davis). Waller's duties are to assemble the ragtag team known as the Suicide Squad--ominous (yet talented) jailbirds tapped to step in and assume superhero status (especially when the real superheroes are tied up in other crime-stopping affairs) while helping out for the greater good of our vulnerable society. In exchange for the Suicide Squad's sacrifice in turning from hell-bent heels to reluctant heralded heroes they are promised commuted prison sentences should they effectively defend and destroy the deadly foes out to promote heavy-handed havoc across the board.

Conveniently, bureaucratic bigwig Waller (through voiceover) introduces the Suicide Squad and describes what beneficial assets they bring to the turbulent table. Among the naughty notables include the well-known ace sniper Floyd Lawton/Deadshot as well as legendary lethal joy-boy Joker and his better (or perhaps worst half) in girlfriend Harley Quinn. The other toxic tag-a-longs along for the thrill ride of becoming rebellious rescuers include George Harkness/Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Chato Santana/El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Waylon Jones/Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje),  Tatsu Yamashiro/Katana, Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) and Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman).

Overall, **Suicide Squad** is surprisingly depressing and goes through the proverbial motions without so much as taking advantage of its surrealistic makeup. The movie never realizes its excitable potential and drifts into yet another superhero yarn that is more patchy than pronounced. Smith's Deadshot is out in the forefront but for the most part feels restrained and not as spry and savvy as one would imagine. Leto's Joker obviously pales in comparison to the brilliant and mesmerizing psychotic take on the role that earned the late Heath Ledger his posthumous Oscar statuette. In all fairness, nobody could inhabit the Clown Prince of Crime as Ledger uncannily did with committed concentration. Still, Leto's Joker--although viciously off-balance--felt recycled and furiously empty at times. Robbie's turn as Joker's misguided main squeeze merely comes off as a bratty Barbie Doll with synthetic edginess. The other **Squad** participants settle for the back burner more or less which is a crying shame because they should have been more engaged than the tepid material allowed them to be initially.

Woefully sketchy and missing the fueled opulence that one would expect emerging from this cockeyed costume caper **Suicide Squad** is a detonating dud for the missing explosive DC Comics movie brand that needs to step up the pace if they expect to make a consistent and challenging impression on the devoted fanboys at the box office looking to move beyond the sardonic fantasy-based realm of another redundant serving of a _Batman/Superman_ entry.

Asadullah Khan,"Suicide Squad is the third and latest entry into the DCEU, and is about a bunch of bad guys that are rounded up to fight for someone else. And just like this year's BvS, this movie received overwhelmingly negative reviews by the critics and was divided among the fans. I was super curious to watch it because unlike many, I actually enjoyed the DCEU till this point. Enjoyed both Man of Steel and BvS. But unfortunately, this one's a mess.

The majority of the movie just feels choppy, editing was all over the place. Like they had a final product but because of disagreements, they took out a lot of scenes, shorten the runtime, and added others, making a giant choppy mess in the end. Scenes don't properly flow, including the flashbacks. Some scenes feel like they were added later (Probably the re-shoots) and they definitely didn't fit, particularly the elevator scene with Harley. The songs were all over the place as well. Some worked with their respective scenes, but most of them didn't, and again it felt like something added later, to give the movie a more jolly feel. And difference between development given to each member of the squad is astounding. Some were completely left in the dust, while some got a bit of line here and there, while some got a lot more development. Basically, to me it felt like that the movie reeked of studio involvement.

Also, the focus was just off. Movie is called Suicide Squad yet there is a whole lot of other stuff that gets way too much screentime. The whole end of the world plot was totally generic, uninteresting and unnecessary. The villain wasn't good, and the movements were weird, and not in a good way. Joker-Harley romance was also something padded on, and could have been removed in exchange for more screentime with the squad. 

Speaking of the Joker, he and his whole weird mafia/gangster lord type vibe didn't work for me. Jared Leto felt like he was trying too hard at times. There were moments where I saw the Joker I wanted in him, but those moments were swiftly followed by over the top feel that he gave most of the time. And that laugh....Yeah NOPE!!  

Even the action was mostly OK, apart from a couple of good scenes. There was no proper thrill, no proper buildup. Too many cuts. Say what you want about Snyder, but you have to admit that the dude can atleast direct amazing action sequences. 

And all of that sucks because there is stuff in the movie that works, like the main squad. Will Smith as Deadshot was great. He played his usual cool self and it worked. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was sexy and mostly good, because there were few instances where her dialogues gave me cringe. These two had a good chemistry together too. Also liked other members like El Diablo, Killer Croc, and captain Boomerang, all of whom were likable, had some fun moments etc. 

Plus, among all the mediocrity, there were glimpses of what the movie could have been like. Fun moments between the squad, some touchy moments, rare cool action sequences, full group scenes or rather a scene, the bar scene and such. 

Ultimately, The movie is like a mediocre cake covered with a thin layer of good frosting. The overall taste isn't bad, but it isn't good either. You enjoy the good frosting for a short while, and then have to deal with a whole lot of mediocre tasting body of the cake. I was disappointed. I really REALLY wanted to like this film. Pushed back all the negative or positive criticism and went in with an open mind. I'm not too hopeful what the extended cut will improve as 13 mins of footage isn't much, and I'm guessing it is Joker footage mostly.

It's funny that after watching this, I respect MCU more now considering what they were able to do with the more risky project: Guardians of the Galaxy.

Gimly,"Some semi-interesting visuals and a few characters I'd like to get to know, but an absolute mess of a movie. The thing feels like a trailer, or a clipshow, or a music video or some other sort of two-hour long promotional material for the actual _Suicide Squad_ that comes out later.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
Reno,"**They are not superheroes, they are supervillains.**

It's nothing against DC, but overall I'm starting to think the todays cinema is getting crowded with the lots of superheroes. Just like any pollution or the over population on the earth's surface. It needs stability, but nobody cares about it other than money making agenda. I also think it's going to last for only a few more years, when this trend going to end like that happened in the 70s, 80s and the 90s. And the space travel era to begin which is already kick- started. So DC or Marvel and others, they should be careful, for far they could take their products.

Like the title say, it's not just about the film characters, the film itself a suicidal. I'm not saying the film was unnecessary, but the plot was dragged too much. There are too many pauses, or you can call time wasting moments. I could not take another blowing up city concept. And that swirling thing in the sky, I don't know how long they are going to use it in the superhero films. I did not like the supernatural concept which is supposed to be a pure science fiction action adventure. At least Thor was from another planet, more like he's an alien, but the witch in this film, ruined my appetite.

The actors were not bad and so the graphics, including the stunt sequences. The story was very familiar. It was more or less, same as the animated flick 'Monsters vs Aliens'. It can be watched for entertainment purpose, the majority won't say it's their favourite or one of the best of the year. But surely there are people who would love it. It was a massive box office hit and I don't see any hurdle for its sequel, but all I hope is it to get better in the follow-up. So finally, it's not a bad film or boring, but it just did not have the midas touch that all the superhero films had. That means a watchable film, only for once.

_5/10_"
ColinJ,"Aka NEEDLE DROP: THE MOVIE

SUICIDE SQUAD is a mess. But an entertaining, well-cast mess."
in_the_crease,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Suicide Squad has a horrible script. First, there was the story--such as it was--itself: A super villain with the power to end the world goes to work in a universe that has established Batman and Wonder Woman. So what do the authorities do? Call up Batman and Wonder Woman? Of course not! Hire a bunch of criminals to save the world.

It would be like if the U.S. was invaded by China, and we went and got the Taliban to protect us.

So, from the very bones of the story, the movie fails. Add in a tell-and-don't-show approach to characterization, and horrendous dialogue, and this film was doomed before it got off the printed page. I really wanted to like this film, but I just couldn't.

So, let's go back to the tell-and-don't-show approach to the characters. Instead of seeing and experiencing anything, we're told what such-and-such is all about. It's an incredibly boring and lazy style of writing. Look at he scene where the principal characters all sit around and tell stories while they have a drink. But that's the thing: They shouldn't be telling us anything. Everything that is told to us as if we're a classroom of elementary school students instead of adults who can put two and two together, should be revealed through each character's dialogue and actions. But that would require some actual writing. This movie seems like it simply filmed the first draft of the screenplay. And then there's the dialogue itself. ""I've already killed one family; I won't kill another."" Who wrote this? A high school kid who thought he was being deep? Flagg refers to the love of his life as the girl he ""was sleeping with."" Serious? You're risking your life to save some broad you're banging? And then after two hours of watching Harley pine for Joker and reject the rest of the members of her ""squad"", she's finally given the chance to be with the Joker and live happily ever after. Well, despite everything we've seen for the past two hours alluding to the fact that that is exactly what she wants, she rejects that for ""her friends."" She's never shown any sort of friendship so far in this movie. But, dialogue. 

It's typical fill-in-the-blank writing. So, Harley didn't show any love for her ""friends"" but did for Joker. And then chose her ""friends"" over the Joker. So, I guess it's up to the audience to ""fill in the blank"" and decide what Harley's change of heart was all about? It shouldn't be the audience's responsibility to do the writer's job.

The characters themselves were boring and uninteresting. Despite wasting the first 20 or so minutes on the film trying to make us love the psychotic Harley Quinn and mass murdering Deadshot, I didn't care. I just couldn't care for anyone or anything happening. It was like there was an invisible barrier between me and the screen. I just couldn't get into the movie. And since no one other than Harley, Deadshot, and Flagg got a pointless backstory introduction, the audience feels, subconsciously, that these are the characters that will carry the story. They don't. The only character that was even remotely interesting was Katana. And despite a few flashes here and there of decent martial arts and kenjutsu action, the character is wasted.

And speaking of wasted characters, let's talk Joker. Jared Leto was upset how much of the Joker was cut from the film. If you can cut such a big name and charismatic character down to the point where the actor playing him complains, and still get away with a finished film, the problems with the script become apparent. Joker was wasted in this film. You cut him out entirely, the overall story doesn't change. So, why include him in the first place? Because shared universe...maybe? Or something? I don't know. And neither do the filmmakers.

And while I know almost everyone on the planet--including those who despise the movie--praise Margot Robbie's Harley, I found her shtick getting old rather quickly. And then to top that off, she reneges on her established motive, thus making her a totally pointless character.

And, before we move on from the topic of bad characterization, what was with Amanda Waller (a good guy...I guess?) executing FBI agents? I feel like I missed the most important scene in the movie--the one that shows something that makes the entire movie make sense. But then again, Amanda Waller doesn't make good choices. She has a folder, inside of which is a list of the upcoming DCEU characters: Aquaman, Flash, Cyborg, etc. She actually has dinner with Batman. But she puts the world's fate in the hands of Diablo, Boomerang, Harley Quinn and Deadshot. It's like calling the police because of a problem, and then scouring death row for the people who will actually solve this problem. Yeah, I'm confused too.

But let's go to the ending. Because the ending shows us one thing: That the Suicide Squad's involvement in all of this was totally pointless. Simple bombs end up saving the day. Bombs. Man made, average, everyday bombs. Satchel charges. Any idiot in a uniform can detonate a bomb. So, why let out a bunch of mass murderers to save the world, if saving the world only involves setting off satchel charges? I mean, why not call the Air Force in, have them drop a couple of bombs, and send a guaranteed-to-be-disappointed-audience-anyway home early? One phone call to the Pentagon, and the ENTIRE MOVIE is UNNECESSARY. But, DC.

In the end, this movie was a total disaster."
Andres Gomez,"Interesting enough and with a decent script for this kind of Sci-Fi movies. The FX are also OK.

Tom Cruise does an OK job and Emily Blunt nails her character, being the brightest thing in screen every time she appears."
casinoslotguy,"Not a bad movie, got kind of sick of the ""ground hog day"" effect. Could have used less of that, all in all pretty enjoyable to watch."
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"I have to say that this movie was surprisingly enjoyable. I did have my doubts about it. I always have doubts about movies that manipulate time. I guess one advantage the movie has is that it does not really involve time travel and changing the past to influence the future but “only” resetting a day and living it over and over again.

The entire concept is of course still totally ludicrous. Even if we forget about the feasibility about resetting time altogether there are just so many things that are wrong with the concept. For example, is time reset all over the universe or just on Earth? Both of those avenues create their own issues further down the line of course. Even if we try to forget these larger issues there are the issue that as soon as Cage altered his own behavior from one repetition of that day to another he would alter the chain of events and what he knew was the events in the previous repeat would no longer be certain in the one he was living right then. Not to mention that he had a longer and longer chain of people to convince on a single day and still get the job done.

Okay, enough harping about that. If you manage to lock out all these annoying issues with the story what remains is, as I wrote before, actually a fairly enjoyable movie. It is primarily a science fiction action movie of course and the action as well as special effects are not bad at all. We get treated to plenty of the classical déjà vu scenes were Cage tries to convince people by predicting their immediate future in minute details. Classical and very not innovative but well done and I have to admit that I am a bit of a sucker for these impress-and-surprise someone scenes. On the whole the movie managed to use the basic concept of reliving the day and make it feel reasonable fresh despite it not being a entirely new idea. The fact that the acting was quite adequate and that both Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt made a good performance as far as I am concerned of course helped.

Naturally the movie builds up towards the climactic battle against the alien central organism and of course everyone (who Cage managed to convince) have to throw in their lives to get Cage in position for the final attack. Personally I liked the ending although I have to say that I was a bit miffed that the writer did not manage to come up with some more imaginative ending scene between Cage and Rita though.

Bottom line, an enjoyable movie well worth watching."
Grant English,"What makes <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>'s 'failure' a bit surprising is how many of us have always wondered - what would happen if you put <em>Groundhog Day</em> in the context of an invasion of Earth by aliens keen on destroying the human race?  Okay...so bad example.  

This is about action, killing aliens, and getting in as many 'gallows humor' one-liners as possible.  And I realize it tanked in the theaters (relatively speaking) but (I can't believe I'm going to say this)...

But it's a fun movie.  It's entertaining, the directing is sharp and quick.  In <em>Groundhog Day</em>, about the 4th time you ""I Got You Babe"" you are screaming at the film - ""WE GET IT!!!  MOVE THE STORY ALONG!!""  That never happens in <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>.  Each cycle through, the story advances and another layer is revealed.  The director seems to get that the audience is smart and they can keep up.

Tom Cruise is well, he's Tom Cruise.  But Emily Blunt is fantastic in the film.  

The ending was a bit of a head-scratcher.  Won't spoil it here but the rest of the movie works and thought it was very entertaining.  It's a fun action movie - and there's nothing wrong with that."
John Chard,"Resetting the day.

Edge of Tomorrow is directed by Doug Liman and collectively written by Christopher McQuarrie, Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth. It stars Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, with music by Christophe Beck and cinematography by Dion Beebe.

It has proved to be a great decade for sci-f, it seems that for every misfire there are three great genre films to off set the disappointments. Sitting at the top end of the table is Edge of Tomorrow (AKA: Live Die Repeat). Adapted from Hiroshi Sakurazaka's novel ""All You Need Is Kill"", the story has Cruise as William Cage, an American army Major who upon being thrust into combat against an alien race decimating Earth, finds he awakens to the same day after being killed in action. Seeking out Rita (Blunt), the most decorated soldier of the time, Cage must understand what is happening to him and hopefully save the future of mankind.

So far so Groundhog Day/Source Code then, but Liman's film never lets up from the get go, frenetic with its action, funny into the bargain, and also sexy, it manages to blend audience pleasing conventions with clever thought and process. There's nothing new in the philosophy on show, and there are regular sci-fi tropes for familiarity of genre, but if you are going to recycle formula then do it with verve and swagger, which this most assuredly does. Boosted by Cruise turning in a good one as an unlikable character who develops into a protag to shout for, and Blunt as a super sexy bad-ass poster girl for the war effort, Edge of Tomorrow ultimately rocks. The science will obviously infuriate those who take such things way too seriously, but as the terror of this particular war unfolds on screen (nifty effects), and we have been bought wholesale into our heroes and their quest, its small failings are hardly worth cocking a snook at. 8/10"
AstroNoud,"On your feet, maggot! The idea of resetting time is being fully explored and adds to the action – and who doesn’t like to see Tom Cruise die over and over again?

mooney240,"**Exceptional performances, effects, story, and pacing round out this amazing film making it worth Live, Watch, and Repeating.**

Edge of Tomorrow (or Live. Die. Repeat.) is an exhilarating mash-up of time-loops, alien invasions, war, and post-apocalyptic humanity struggling for survival. Add Tom Cruise’s charismatic coward to champion and Emily Blunt’s battle-hardened warrior into that mix, and this movie soars from a cool idea to an astonishing sci-fi epic! The pacing was excellent, which can be tricky in time-loop movies, but Doug Liman masterfully guides the story and Cruise’s character arc hitting just the right beats. The movie stays engaged as the story still jumps from challenge to challenge and location to location while in the time-loop keeping the movie fresh and exciting. The performances, directing, writing, and pacing make Edge of Tomorrow an underrated treasure."
John Chard,"You're a fool to believe in something you've never seen.

Waterworld is directed by Kevin Reynolds and jointly written by David Twohy, Peter Rader and Joss Whedon. It stars Kevin Costner, Dennis Hopper, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Tina Majorino, Michael Jeter and Gerard Murphy. Music is scored by James Newton Howard and cinematography by Dean Semler.

It's the future and the polar ice caps have melted and the Earth is practically covered by the sea. As civilisation is forced to live on the water, their only hope is to one day find the fabled place known as Dryland. A Mariner drifter may hold the key to Dryland's whereabouts...

It was by definition a troubled shoot, with sackings, difference of opinions, cost overruns, production set backs (hurricane destroying a hugely expensive set) and bad word of mouth generated by a film press intent on giving Kevin Costner a good kicking. Facts are, now that all the water has evaporated over the years, Waterworld is neither the flop or the bad film that many believed it to be. Should it be a better movie considering the gargantuan amounts of cash spent on it? Absolutely, without question! But Waterworld turned a decent profit in spite of its problems and mixed reviews, and now it firmly has a fan base willing to love it for the great sci-fi escapism that it is. Now readily available in 3 cuts (Theatrical, TV Edit and Ulysses), you can sample each to find the pros and cons of home format film tampering.

Even in its theatrical form the film is still a rollicking water based adventure, full of spectacular stunts (oh my those jet-skis rock), amazing sets (whoosh, the sci-fi grandeur of the floating atoll) and blood pumping scenes (the eerie journey and subsequent revelation of a city under water). Sure it's far from flawless as the pace is uneven at times and as plot narratives go it's pretty thin, but Reynolds and Costner have crafted an impressive world submerged by water. The cast, too, are delivering knowing performances. Costner's Mariner is indeed one note, unsympathetic and moody, this guy is a loner and a mutation after all, his sombre persona neatly playing against Hopper's cartoonish, satirical and maniacal villain. Tripplehorn (a porn star name if ever there was one!) beautifully shines in a film populated predominantly by males (there's another flaw for you), Michael Jeter scores favourably as a highly strung elder, while young Majorino is suitably winsome, neatly playing it as a device to mellow the Mariner's cold fishy heart. Take that and fill it out with the detail of the definitive cut (Ulysses) which showcases Reynolds' vision and it's fan nirvana all round.

If it was meant to be a serious picture in the first place, a sermon on topical destroying of the Earth, then it fails a touch because the characterisations are bound by cliché manacles. Yet collectively the inhabitants of this Waterworld share a common goal of survival, played out to the backdrop of Reynolds' excellent futuristic setting. When thrust together to make a good versus evil action movie, the characterisations work handsomely within that framework. That is ultimately the best way to enjoy Waterworld, let it wash over you (hrr hrr hrr) in a wave (hrr, OK I'll stop now) of water based action and heroics. It's a world where soil is currency and smoking is a marker for being a bad guy. From the opening shot of the Universal World logo becoming submerged in water, to the bittersweet finale, yes! Waterworld is indeed escapism in its purest cinematic form and becomes a high definition must in the process. 8/10"

Filipe Manuel Dias Neto,"**Rather poorly edited and cut, this film is downright forgettable.**

I've seen this movie twice, and I honestly can't believe it. It was truly the same as burning money. After being impressed by the poor quality of the film, I went to read and research about it, and discovered the eventual cause of this disaster: from the beginning, it was a project doomed to failure. Badly planned, it was filmed in a place where the weather conditions would cause problems. The ambition to do more and better is healthy, but in this case it caused an escalation of costs. To make things more difficult, the production was guided by Kevin's disagreement against Kevin, since the director, Kevin Reynolds, was contradicted several times by the main actor, Kevin Costner. The most blatant disagreement may have happened during post-production, with the actor and the studio demanding a straight cut of the film, which was lame and poorly edited. It had everything to go wrong...

I know, now, that there are extended versions of the film, but I haven't found a ""director's cut"" that would be able to reverse the changes and give us the version that Reynold initially envisioned. What I saw is the “canonical version” of about two hours, and I hated it. The script is based on a very apocalyptic and poorly explained future, where the entire world is flooded, and a myth has been created where, somewhere, there would be land, but which no one has actually been able to confirm. The few surviving people live on atolls and artificial islands, and on boats. The film never shows us a storm, a hurricane or anything that threatens the lives of those survivors, nor does it explain how they survived, or why no one properly explores the world to discover signs of earth. There are a lot of loose ends and absurdities, and the film will only work if we avoid thinking about it too much.

The cast rests solidly on Kevin Costner's back, and even those who aren't particularly fans of the actor will have to agree that he makes a good acting exercise, and is charismatic enough to ensure the role that is expected of him, especially if we're considering how indigestible and unsympathetic his character can be. Dennis Hopper is a likable villain, more cartoonish than truly menacing. Jeanne Tripplehorn is decent and satisfying.

Technically, the film stands out for its commitment to excellent production values, with the effort and financial expenditure applied being clear: the choice of filming locations is very good, despite having brought many practical and logistical difficulties to the production; the cinematography takes every opportunity to make the film beautiful and elegant. The sets and costumes, made extremely realistically, are excellent, and you can see that they were expensive and detailed. The action scenes were well-thought-out and executed, and could have been better had the film not been structured for such a low rating. Good effects and a soundtrack that satisfies without enchanting make up the overall picture of a rather forgettable film."
JPV852,Entertaining in parts but a mess of a plot with some shoddy visual effects even by 2009 standards. Some stunt work was alright but nothing that really stands out and none of the cast really were all that memorable. Did appreciate some of the nods to the cartoons but otherwise just very forgettable. **2.75/5**
Fatota,This is the most incredible movie I've ever seen :)
Andres Gomez,"Another great movie from Pixar. The story in entangling and is structured in a master way to show us in a nice recreation how the mind works and emotions like sadness are important for a healthy life.

A must to be seen."
Sxerks3,"A powerfully moving story, Inside Out takes place inside the mind of a young girl, Riley, as she tackles relatively normal hassles, from growing up to moving away. Inside her mind comes five emotions, all with different perceptions of life.

There's Joy, who takes charge and her job is to keep Riley content, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust, and together, they work together (or try) to keep Riley from harming herself. They live together in the headquarters, or Riley's head, and they look after Riley's memories.

After eleven years of enjoyment and content, Riley and her parents are forced to move out of Minnesota, away from her friends and hockey team, and moves to the city of San Francisco inside a desolate and cold house.

But things get even more anarchic when Joy and Sadness are sundered away from the rest of the gang, holding onto Riley's core memories that make Riley, well, Riley. One by one, the islands of personality fall apart as the rest of the gang back in headquarters watch in dismay and anguish. After all, Joy is not there to keep things under control.

Inside Out truly contemplates the hardships of growing up, but every problem comes to a heart-wrenching solution. The movie truly captivates this and continues the Pixar tradition of inspiration, family, and friendship in a little bit under two hours. Watch this, you must."
Peter McGinn,"I think this is one of the best animated feature films I have ever seen, perhaps even the best one. It is very imaginative, for a start, colorful in ways that capture the eye, and its message is as deep as you want it to be.

By that I mean it would be productive and fun to watch this with children of all ages. The older or more mature the child is, the deeper you can delve into the issues of what to do about feelings of anger, sadness, and so on. With young children, you could even watch it first time through as it is, and save comments or life lessons for additional viewings. There is plenty of action and humor to be found here to entertain hem on that level.

And as a side note, we have no small children to watch this with, but it is also a good movie for adults to settle into, especially during times of stress or worry. We read a recommendation for it during the COVID19 crisis."
r96sk,"Sweet story.

<em>'Inside Out'</em> produces an entertaining, heartfelt 95 minutes. I like how the characters work and how their world is set up, conceptually it works very nicely but visually I don't love it - something about the way it looks is kinda plain to me. While Joy & Co. are memorable, the voices behind them aren't all that standout in my opinion.

Phyllis Smith is my pick of the cast, she is the perfect person to play the character Sadness. Amy Poehler (Joy) and Lewis Black (Anger) are more than satisfactory, too.

It has a good message and meaning, for me it's just missing something extra. Still enjoyed it though."
Kamurai,"Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

This is a wonderfully little story of world building and exploration of the human mind through a young teen girl who is scare of the huge amount of change happening in her life.  The parallel of internal struggle and outward reaction to adversity really sets this movie apart.

The audience is literally taken on a exploration of the mind, and the story is not only fun, but capable of serious philosophical concepts.  Because it exemplifies ""show, don't tell"" those conversations are compacted into palatable actions by the characters.

This is a movie that might make you laugh, cry or both.

It's hard to believe that someone wouldn't relate to this somehow, and probably more that they wouldn't enjoy it at all."

Austin Singleton,"A great movie for the whole family. Watch my full review here.

Reno,"> The red flower adventure!

The Rudyard Kipling's famous children's book was adapted numerous times for stage shows, television series, live-shot and animation films, and now here's the modern version and also the first digital 3D version. The Disney done it again bring all the classics to a new life, but it is a great team work, especially the post-production was terrific.

It is one of those stories never gets boring for repeat reading/listening/viewing. Of course, there were plenty of changes to the original source, but I would say it was upgraded so well. Jon Favreau did an awesome job as the director, definitely it is his one of the best films and will be remembered for very long. All the above he got the best screenplay with supportive production and crew.

Neel Sethi was obviously a perfect choice for the man-cub, he had given his best and no one could doubt it was his first film. The entire film was shot in the studio settings and the whole time he had to act alone, because the remaining characters in the film are CGI. So in that viewpoint he actually did a breathtaking job being a very young.

The CGI characters were really excellent, but the non-fur animals like elephant looked a bit fake. I mean anatomically and character performances were perfect, only visually the 3D models were out of the blend in the screen with others. These are very small things to notice, but for the todays technology, it was not bad, especially thinking the film is primarily targeted children.

The story was simple, like half of the film was an introduction and almost all the important characters from the book were launched at a high profile. It was actually the story with a backdrop of red flower. So the narration moves different part of the jungle, lot like the levels in a game. Various adventures take place and well composed stunt sequences.

I mentioned stunts right, but there were no violences, I mean nothing seriously to concern about as expected for a Disney film. Yet because of those actions, the film is very much suitable for adult viewing. So apart from the children and families, it can be watched by anyone. One of the top Disney films to do best at the box office worldwide by grabbing almost $1b.

So aggressive, furious Shere Khan ever to portray. I think the little children may get scared for his unpleasant face look and the strong roar. By the way all the songs were amazing and the end credit was very interesting. Finally, I saw it after a long wait and anticipation, most importantly, I'm very happy how beautifully it was made.

The film was not shot in India, but the locations were so resembling and gives the perfect Indian feel. Climbing a cliff by Baloo and fighting the monkeys, like that there were numerous jokes. Surely one of the grandly made children's film at the recent time. I've heard the sequel is already on the progress, so bring it on, at least a trilogy before Neel turn to a big boy.

Gimly,"I had only one true issue with Jon Favreau's _Jungle Book_, and while it does seem like sort of an unfair one, it's also a pretty huge one.

For months before I got the chance to see this remake, I heard non-stop about what a great actor the kid playing Mowgli was, how photorealistic all the animals were, and how you would never be able to guess that the backgrounds were all actually sound stages that had been animated over. Well I just watched _The Jungle Book_, and I found all three of those compliments to be patently untrue. That might sound like three issues, but in reality they all boil down to the same one thing, suspension of disbelief. Or more accurately, the lack of it. From the word go, there wasn't s moment that I found myself being continuously drawn out of the story because of one of those reasons (usually the look of the creatures). I was not once able to fully engage, and though I recognise that from a plot point of view, this version was even better than the 1967 one, I still found myself constantly aggravated by the harsh meshing of Mowgli against the world around him.

_Final rating:★★½ - Not quite for me, but I definitely get the appeal._"
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"This is without a doubt a very good family movie. Many people seem to compare it unfavorably with the “original” animated movie from Walt Disney. To me these are quite different movies and should not really be compared. I have not read the book but I have a feeling that this movie follows the book more closely. It is a wee bit darker, more serious and incredibly beautiful to watch.

I quite liked the original jungle book movie. It was one of my favorites when I was a kid. I am therefore quite happy that this was not just a “dumb” remake with modern CGI and that I quite liked this take of the classic story. This movie is, as I wrote, much more serious and a wee bit darker. It is less of a children’s movie than the original.

The wolves are getting much more time in this movie which is good. Mowgli’s opponents are also much less comical and much more sinister. Kaa is a beastly snake with no remorse, King Louie is a huge, scheming, and tyrannical ape King and finally Shere Khan is a ruthless, human hating, tiger that kills anyone or anything that stands in his way.

The CGI is top notch as far as I am concerned. The jungle scenery is absolutely stunning and it is really worth watching the movie just for the scenery. Combined with a classic adventure story that is not half bad makes for a really a good movie.
I was definitely positively surprised by this movie. For me it is a big success."
Kamurai,"Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

I'll honestly go as far as to recommend this over the original 1967 version.

I don't think is quite as charming as the original, and it has a very different animation style, both with great quality of detail in it.  From the individual strains of fur, to the types of animals included (I've done so much research on Indian wildlife today), you can really see the details of the cg effects.  Just watch the end credit sequence alone, and it'll prove it.

There are 3 huge improvements to this versus others: Sher Khan's face, King Louie, and the intensity of the animal fight scenes.  The movie isn't free of problems: I imagine someone will have issues with talking animals vs non-talking animals, that he'd have to learn the language (so how would he ever understand Sher Khan or Baloo?).

If anything, I think the writing took a hit.  Where the original had a subtle but strong fables sequencing to it (sort of modular moral stories with shifting focus on characters), this is structured much closer to how many video game stories are structured, serialized chapters with some level of power creep and shifting focus of environment and goals but all focused on Mowgli.  And I don't think the writing is bad, but this Jungle kid (never actually reveals his backstory, somewhat of a relief honestly) is performing clean engineering using vines and pulleys and armor (that wouldn't work) with calculated positioning.  I understand that some people just have talent for some things, but I had to question whether or not I could do the same thing.  I could, but I'd have to do it different ways.

And in all fairness some of the stupid /inconsistent things he gets up too, even though he's a ""take charge"" Mowgli in this version really got to me: I was literally cheering for Sher Khan at certain points.

Ultimately I had a good time with it, and I think most people and possibly their pets will too (my cats were interested for a while)."
ohlalipop,"It was understood that the theaters would be sold out but when the three of us came there we just couldn't accept NO for an answer. So we were finally able to buy tickets BUT we were seated separately. It was fine though. The movie kept me entertained. Except for the guy near me who was snoring pretty loud, the movie was great.


Of course Robert Downey Jr was amazing as always. There might be weird critics with this movie but for me, I liked it. The action scenes were just right. It wasn't too much and it wasn't too little. It was weird seeing Don Cheadle though play Terrence Howard's character. I like Terrence better. And then there's Scarlett Johansson who is really sexy although I think there weren't that many acting for her in this movie. There weren't many lines. And what was weird also was that in this movie, the chemistry between Tony Stark and Pepper was not that much compared to the first movie although in this movie they actually ended up together. But all in all I liked the movie. Seeing old characters from the first movie and new characters. I can't wait for a 3rd Iron Man movie.


My rate for this movie is B+."
Dan_Tebasco,"Yet another ridiculously high rated Marvel movie, we get it Marvel fanboys you just love it when a new Marvel movie comes out, so much that you forget any flaws in it and give it a 10 or a 9 anyways.

But come on seriously? Wouldn't you rather they spent a little time at actually writing a somewhat decent script and making it a bit more entertaining than to praise EVERYTHING they do to the skies just because you want a new chapter in the Marvel universe?

Cause this is NOT a good movie, 35 minutes of decent at best action and 85 minutes of nonsensical blabber.

Mickey Rourke was the only highlight in this movie, the scene at the racetrack with him was really cool but then he just became a wasted opportunity just like the rest of the movie.

A really boring turd of a film."
Gimly,"**A long form review originally posted in 2010:**

I find, the best way to look at this movie, is as two movies. Sounds strange I know, but bear with me.

On the one hand you have this Super Hero movie, it's about the main character, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), flying around doing comic book-character type stuff, and it's this pretty okay action film that's worth taking a look at. Then, there's this drama with a hint of comedy, this other film isn't really a genre, it's just about the characters interacting with each other, it's about the main character, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), driving around doing billionaire-playboy type stuff, and this movie, is fucking great. Part script, and part flawless acting, this movie sets _Iron Man 2_ apart from any other Super Hero film out there. It was explored in the first film, and you get a similar thing there, but in this movie the division is more clear, and it bizarrely benefits from it.

When films go franchise-style, it's inevitable that there will be scheduling conflicts, it's an unfortunate part of the industry, particularly when you have a deadline to meet, and for whatever reason, an actor will be unable to return to their original role. Such an event takes place in _Iron Man 2_ when Lt. Col. James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (originally played by Terrance Howard) is replaced by Don Cheadle. I personally think that Howard was better suited to the role, simply because he looks more like Rhodey does in the comics. But their way of dealing with the changeover is simple, and clever, the character's first lines, whilst making perfect sense in context, are ""Look, it's me, I'm here, deal with it. Let's move on. Drop it."" Very classy.

Although Mickey Rourke (_Get Carter, Sin City, The Wrestler, Man on Fire, The Expendables_) manages a very convincing evil Russian; Ivan Vanko, who's a perfectly good character, Whiplash as a villain is unfortunately somewhat lacking. Sam Rockwell (_The Green Mile, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Frost/Nixon, Moon, Conviction_) plays Justin Hammer, corporate rival of Stark's. Scarlett Johansen (_Eight Legged Freaks, The Girl with a Pearl Earring, The Island, The Prestige, The Spirit_) is another good addition to the cast, in the role of Natalie Rushman A.K.A Natasha Romanoff A.K.A Black Widow. Samuel L. Jackson (_Jurassic Park, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, The Starwars Prequel Trilogy, Shaft, S.W.A.T, Kill Bill Volume 2, Snakes on a Plane, 1408, The Spirit, Inglourious Basterds_) portraying S.H.I.E.L.D Director Nick Fury, rounds out the newbies in the cast. And it's all good news.

The Hammerdrones are an attempt at revamping the whole boss-battle that was such a let down in the original film, which honestly, once again didn't really work out. Once again it's a case of the character interaction that makes the film what it is. The effects also went a long way in the line of helping out the film, 'cause they were awesome. There are a couple of negatives in the script, just those moments when the suspension of disbelief is not... suspend-y enough. As for example the line; ""Congratulations sir, you have created a new element"", is a little flawed.

Though if I was forced to choose between them, I would probably say that _Iron Man_ is the better of the two films, but _Iron Man 2_ has a better re-watch value in my opinion, which I prize highly. I wait with baited breath for the next Marvel film to come out, _Thor_.

tmdb44006625,"Honestly, it took me three tries to get through this movie once. It kept putting me to sleep.

The cast do everything they can to make their scenes entertaining, but Iron Man 2 is a just an absolute waste of two hours and $200 million. 1: The stupidly integrated villain Ivan Vanko who is given no backstory or true relatable motive (even Mickey Rourke was pissed at how his character was handled). 2: The pointless subplot of how Tony Stark has to create a new element to save himself. 3: The sloppy introductions of both SHIELD and Black Widow. There's very little here that is of any actual entertainment value, or at least to balance out how tedious the whole movie is to watch. No wonder why Jon Favreau left to make more personal works."
JPV852,"Says a lot, but took now a decade to finally see this sequel. Certainly belongs in the lower tier of the MCU as the plot really felt disjointed and even though it was only two hours, really short for a comic book movie nowadays, still felt so much longer. That said, had a few okay moments yet can't really say anything stood out. **2.75/5**"
r96sk,"<em>'Iron Man 2'</em> is good, nothing special, but good.

Robert Downey Jr. is just as entertaining in the lead role, while the specials efforts are again pleasing. The score, which I found slightly lacking in <em>'Iron Man'</em>, is improved. The plot isn't as interesting, or all that creative, but it's done well enough that I didn't ever feel bored; though some of the pacing is off.

I like Don Cheadle so it's good to see him come in, even if his character is rather forgettable. Scarlett Johansson is also a solid addition, though Sam Rockwell didn't do anything for me in his role. Mickey Rourke is fun enough as Ivan."
Filipe Manuel Dias Neto,"**A predictable sequel that continues the story of the first film without, however, being as good as it is.**

After an excellent first movie, this was a predictable sequel, but I have to admit that the movie is a bit over the top and that, sometimes, it feels like a very expensive video game. Furthermore, the main character, Tony Stark, is perhaps one of the nastiest and most irritating comic heroes, and this movie seems to try to accentuate that by turning the protagonist into a spoiled playboy who has expensive toys and looks at women like if they were, also, toys. Okay, I know the character was also portrayed like that in the original books, even though I'm not a comics fan. But the movie could give something that made Tony Stark someone we could really care about.

In this film, the hero will face his first great antagonist, the son of a Soviet scientist that Stark's father knew. At the same time, Stark has to face the US Army, who are eager to get their hands on the combat suits he created, discovering that his father knew of a new chemical element, not yet officially discovered, and in which lies the key for the survival of Stark himself. With these brief lines, we can see, right away, that the script is not exactly one of the strong points of the film. The feeling that remains is that the script shoots in several directions, trying to create a more complex story, but that something got in the way and prevented that objective.

The cast basically has the same names as the previous film. Robert Downey Jr. is back to the red armor for yet another film, where he has shown himself to be deftly sarcastic and irritating without losing his heroic pose. Mickey Rourke is a welcome addition to the cast, playing the villain. The actor was able to adapt to the character quite competently. Samuel L. Jackson, Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle also return, but they don't do more than they did in the previous film, still fulfilling what was asked of them. Scarlett Johansson deserves a praise for her work here, but the rest of the cast just do what needs to be done.

The film is yet another very expensive blockbuster, abundantly financed by Marvel, and it is very obvious that it will become one of the most watched films of the season. With so much money and financial interest involved, the film was doomed to a loud and flashy bet on high-quality, but still obviously false, effects and CGI. The film has a lot of action and the fights are excellent, although obviously choreographed and stilted. The cinematography is crisp, vibrant, and magnificently beautiful. The film bets a lot on quality props, good sets and costumes, as well as a good soundtrack."
doubleyoudot,"Watched in chronological order 2022.

Genius bachelor who's also an idiot makes more advanced toys and fights his company betraying him. Dead daddy's secret message saves the day. Meh."
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"This is not the fairy tale from Walt Disney that we have become used to but a rather more mature dark and sinister movie. I have to say that I enjoyed this movie.

Despite that a lot of the world is much darker and filled of despair in this movie the photography is nice and the film is beautiful to watch. The film focuses a lot more on the huntsman than previous Snow White movies that I have seen and I think this is also the first one that I have seen where snow white mounts up in full battle armor. I think it worked quite well.

There is quite a few special effects in the movie but not enough to overdo it and they are reasonably well done as far as I am concerned. As I mentioned earlier the plot is somewhat different although it follows the general lines of the original story. It is still a fairly simple adventure/action plot but it holds together well enough.

The dwarfs are present of course and, although the film takes much more serious take to the Snow White story, they still give you a laugh or two. There are a couple of scenes which more or less seemed to be fillers with not that much to add to the story but they did not really disturb the flow of the movie either.

When the credits started to roll I was quite satisfied with my movie evening."
DoryDarko,"Ever since I saw the first photographs of Snow White and the Huntsman surface on IMDb about a year ago, I've been extremely excited to see this film. And over the past few weeks, that excitement only built op more and more to the point where almost no film can meet such high expectations. See, I have always loved the fairy tale of Snow White and the evil queen, but never before had anyone attempted to make it into what I believe it was always meant to be: a Gothic tale of fantasy and horror, rather than a sweet night time story. And now, with a much promising trailer, it appeared that Rupert Sanders had fulfilled my wish. And even though he has claimed quite some artistic license story wise, the end very much justifies the means. Snow White and the Huntsman is a film worth watching.

Literally everything I ever imagined about this classic story is there. The Dark Forest is actually Dark. It's creepy and spooky in the best kind of nightmarish way. Funnily enough, throughout the film there were some analogies with the classic Disney film. For instance, in the Dark Forest, the tree branches move autonomously towards whoever dare enter their territory, grasping around like freakish clawing fingers. The mushrooms spew poisonous fumes when you touch them. And the hills literally have eyes... The Evil Queen's castle is every goth kids' dream house. And the dwarfs are rugged, mean little men. Graphically, there's simply nothing not to love.

However, without the key elements perfectly worked out, the pretty pictures alone wouldn't have made this film work. Let me start with the leading lady. I don't know why Kristen Stewart is getting so much hate, honestly. Not only is she a very talented young actress, she is the perfect Snow White. I can't imagine anyone doing a better job with this than her. She doesn't just have the right look (pretty face, pale skin and raven dark hair), she also has the right attitude to play Snow White the way her character was written: smart, daring and independent. This is no damsel in distress, this is a girl ready to kick some ass and get revenge. She just needs a little help from her friends. First and foremost friend on the list is Eric, the Huntsman. He is initially hired (or rather, commanded) by the Evil Queen, to hunt down Snow White. However, when he finds out that he has been deceived, he turns on the Queen and decides to help her instead. This character is played by Chris Hemsworth, and he is perfectly cast. He is all the Huntsman needs to be; rugged but charming, complete with a husky Scottish twang. Lastly, there is Snow White's childhood friend William, played by Sam Claflin, who sets out on his own personal mission to help her.

Of course, the tale of Snow White would not have been complete without the notorious 7 (or 8, in this case) dwarfs. It seems the casting director pulled open a can of Britain's finest for this occasion. Bob Hoskins, Ian McShane, Eddie Marsan, Ray Winstone, just to name a few. These characters are a delight to watch and also bring some much needed comic relief to the story, without actually turning it into a comedy (which is a good thing).

And then there's the Evil Queen, Ravenna, played by Charlize Theron. Ms Theron is a great actress, and I was really looking forward to her playing this purely evil character. And as such, the Queen was everything I had hoped for; a heartless, sadistic beauty who relies on dark magic to remain forever young and beautiful, sacrificing whosoever crosses her path for this purpose. Though strangely, viewed solely as a performance, I caught Charlize doing something I had never expected from her: she overacted. Personally I feel that her performance would have actually been much more intense had she decided not to spend half her screen time screaming at the top of her lungs, but rather just some of it, carefully dosed. However, Ms Theron has garnered a more than sufficient amount of brownie points in my book, so I'll just chalk it up to excitement. It's obvious she had a lot of fun playing this character, so she's easily forgiven. Besides, physically she fit the role perfectly and I still really enjoyed watching her.

Visually, Snow White and the Huntsman is truly stunning. The CGI is top-notch, especially the Mirror is quite awesome. It transforms into a human-shaped mass of liquid gold in order to speak, and it's one of the best visual surprises in the film. The Dark Forest is the closest thing I've ever experienced to an acid trip, and all the fantasy creatures are really cool (my favourite was the angry forest troll!).

I don't need to tell you about the story, we all know how it goes (although I've never seen Snow White in a harness before...), so there's no really big surprise anywhere, and of course you get the happy ending (trust me, that's not a spoiler). Still, it's the way this story is told here, that makes it a very exciting ride. There's only one point of critique I have, and that's the pacing. They really could have kicked it up a notch here and there.

I think, in the end, Snow White and the Huntsman actually did live up to my expectations, and that's quite an accomplishment, considering how high they were. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I highly recommend it if you're in the mood for Snow White: The Gothic Version. Beautiful, awesome, cool!

Kamurai,"Great watch, will likely watch again, and do recommend.

This is probably my favorite Snow White story version to date.  I'm a fan of Kristen Stewart, and both Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron are both top tier actors giving amazing performances.

A dark and gritty tale with plenty of money to fuel the amazing CG effects of the movie.  The story is well laid out with complex multi-threading, Each story thread is actually interesting and I've always thought fairy tales like Snow White needed more fight and military battle scenes.

Charlize Theron really steals the show, not only as a villain, but she embodies the insanity of the character and is worth the watch all on its own."
Andres Gomez,"Nice re-interpretation of the sleeping beauty children's tale. Angelina Jolie has some really good moments in which a simple smile from her can make you shit your pants, although the interpretation is, in some parts, irregular. Elle Fanning is not a good option as ""the Beauty"" in the same way Kristen Stewart wasn't for Snow White. Angelina eats completely her role as Charlize Theron eat Stewart's. Sharito Copley has a great performance, as always, and the FX are really decent."
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"When I first read about this movie I was not entirely sure whether I liked the idea or not. After having watched it I have to say that I really liked it. It is a nice fairy tale based on the Sleeping Beauty but from the perspective of the evil fairy (who is not really that evil actually) instead. As far as I am concerned the concept worked surprisingly well.

Obviously the story is highly rewritten compared to the original Sleeping Beauty story. Whether that is good or bad is probably a matter of personal opinion. I think it is good since it allowed to story in the movie to have its own merits and not be too dependent on the original. It works for me since the original story is not very present except and thus you do not get any annoyed every so often because the deviate from the “original” since the movie clearly demonstrated that it intended to be quite different from the start.

The movie is quite beautiful with a typical fairy-tale air to it and at the same time dark and ominous during the scenes that required it. There are plenty of CGI of course and, to me, it was all quite well done. Angeline Jolie did a good job as Maleficent. I was actually less impressed by the three fairies that were supposed to take care of the princess though. They tried to be funny but it never really became very funny.

On the whole I found this to be a very enjoyable movie. So did the kids by the way. When I watched it  (with the kids) the kids had already watched it twice."
DoryDarko,"Today, June 4, I went to see Maleficent on the birthday of its star, Angelina Jolie. In itself, nothing more than a funny coincidence, although when you think about it, it is customary for someone who is celebrating their birthday, to hand out treats. And boy, this was the best treat ever.

Three reasons why I was completely stoked to see Maleficent after hearing about it for the first time about a year and a half ago: 1) I love Angelina. 2) I love Sleeping Beauty. 3) Maleficent is my favourite fairy tale villain of all time. On the other hand, I was also a little wary of the way they had apparently altered the story. See, if there is one thing I hate in films, it's when they explain and justify the motives and reasons why a certain character is ""bad"". I for one believe that some people are just plain evil and that's the way it is. And going into this persons' childhood and explaining how bad everything was (or something to that effect) only works to weaken that characters' force. Now, I don't know why a somewhat clichéd story about the love and betrayal of a young Maleficent (who apparently used to be good and pure-hearted), worked here, but somehow it just did. It completely surprised me, to be honest. I'm usually allergic to this kind of fluff, but it worked! Maleficents' back-story actually intrigued me, moved me even. And it succeeded at what it was supposed to do in the first place: it made Maleficent human.

In the end though, they could have written any kind of story about what is undoubtedly Disney's most beloved villainess, it never would have been raised to an above-par level without its most crucial element: Angelina Jolie. I might sound biased because I'm such a fan, but I am perfectly able to look at her performances in a critical way, and I can only say this about her performance as Maleficent: she was in one word, perfect. I honestly can't imagine any other actress who could have approached this role with the same flawless combination of properties (short of maybe Charlize Theron): she is beautiful and very charismatic, yet at the same time undeniably cruel and cold. She was everything I had hoped this real life characterization of Maleficent would be, and then some. 

Compliments also go out to the three other main actors in this film. First to Elle Fanning, for being very convincing as the young princess Aurora. She is sweet, lovely and kind and she has the right personality to play this famous princess just the way she should be. Second, to Sam Riley, who was a pleasant surprise as Maleficents' pet raven Diaval in human form. I was thus far unfamiliar with his work, but he was very well suited to his role and I enjoyed watching him. Last, but certainly not least, Sharlto Copley, who has already thrilled me with his performances in District 9 and Elysium, and who has now definitely made a fan out of me. His range is awesome and he was totally terrifying as Stefan.

OK, there are some things you have to look past. My first, and most blatant, issue with this film is: if young Maleficent was a good, pure- hearted girl, then why did she, as an innocent 10-year-old, already have evil-looking horns, devilish wings and is she called ""Maleficent""? Right… Secondly, I found the three pixies to be very unconvincing and even somewhat annoying CGI-wise. Overall the special effects are well done but the pixies were definitely an eyesore. The dragon in the end also looked a bit unreal. 

That being said, Maleficents' costumes and make-up were absolutely stunning. I just couldn't get enough of gazing at her intricate headdresses and beautiful gowns. The costume and styling department really deserve top credit and I truly hope there will be some awards for them in the near future. The music was also great, with flawless scoring by James Newton Howard and a terrific rendition of ""Once upon a dream"" by Lana Del Rey over the end credits. Also, awesome battle scenes and action sequences galore!

Going into this film, I thought it would be nothing more than a so-so, kind of fun summer flick. A 6.5/7 maybe. Sometimes, I love it when I'm wrong. Out of the three films that I've seen at the cinema over the last week (the other two being X-Men and Godzilla, both disappointments…) I can tell you, Maleficent was by far the most gratifying. Perhaps because I had relatively low expectations, perhaps because it was simply that good.

One serious warning for the rough, rugged men out there: this film features pixies, fairies, sparkly thingies and magical fluff out the wazoo. If you're going to see this, do it for Angelina. If not, treat this film like kryptonite. You will thank me later.

To everyone else: go see this film. It will rock your socks off. Maleficent is magnificent.

Kamurai,"Good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

I'm not a big Angelina Jolie (""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"") fan, but she definitely nailed the part, and I felt for her when those things happened, so I'm definitely not going to say she's not a good actor.

Elle Fanning (""The Great"") is great, mostly an annoyingly happy little thing while she's awake, alongside wonderful supporting cast and gorgeous (and sometimes goofy) CG animated creatures.

Disney definitely poured money into this to make it look great.  They also spent quite the effort to revitalize the story.  After rewatching ""Sleeping Beauty"" and some other variations (I did fail to reread the original story), I am definitely a fan of the direction they took.  The original story was just so weak and empty, and this does one of my favorite things and humanizes a villain into an adversery into of an evil monster.

I'm not a fan of how or why the 3 faeries get involved, but it makes some sense.  And I'm very happy with how they handled the resolution of the curse.

They created this awesome world which adds to the movie in a very special way."

Angelina Jolie fits as the titular character, bringing with her a good performance. Elle Fanning (Aurora), Sharlto Copley (Stefan) and Sam Riley (Diaval) play their respective roles well enough, but neither come close to matching Jolie - as you'd probably expect.

I found the special effects a bit iffy. It's not that it looks anything close to bad, I just thought it could've looked better. The score isn't all that memorable, either. I did enjoy how the plot unfolds though, mainly thanks to the lead admittedly.

Intrigued to see what the sequel to <em>'Maleficent'</em> has to offer."
BiGuy,"_TL:DR  
An enchanting retelling of a classic story which really holds it's own with the changes in it's story-line. If you love magical worlds, definitely give this one a watch! (7/10 on the Dragon-Scale for including two very badass dragons!)_

I truly appreciate the modern trend of humanizing the ""villains"" in a story, real life is rarely as simple as: 'This person is just evil.' and it allows for so much more depth and emotional investment in both protagonists and antagonists.

Hats off to the visual effects team for making the Moors feel truly enchanted, with many magical critters and beautifully strange fauna all pining for your attention. Everything feels like it has it's own personality through their movement and design, making the whole movie a feast for the eyes. (And I of-course cannot forget the raven-like aspects in all of Diaval's forms. Raven dragon? Yes please!)

As for the story, it takes great inspiration from the original but brings it's own charms to the table. Opting to take the 'Parental Love' definition of true love, rather than Romantic Love. Which is a decision I personally can get behind. (Even _if_ Maleficent is not Aurora's birth-mother, she has certainly been more of a mother to her than her biological mother. Which is another great message to send!)

Lastly, what did I get out of the story? When we're young, we tend to be young, naïve and have an optimistic colorful view of the world. And something will inevitably happen to change our views and jade us. (Making our outlook darker and thornier. _Wink wink nudge nudge._) 

This new outlook will usually stay for years, if not for life, but sometimes we find something or someone who revives (part of) the child we all have inside of us that we wish dearly to protect. (The Moors going from colorful to dark and back to colorful again.) And I can certainly find myself in that."
OSEANSADITYA,"Very epic movie, strong storyline and also stunning graphics.. This is very recommended movie to watch with entire family."
Andres Gomez,"The story may not be the most original, with its Shakespearean turn overs, but it is well shaped and  Serkis performance is remarkable.

The animation of the apes, which was already superb in the previous movie, finally reaches a level in which you can believe they are more real than the human actors.

Maybe a bit too long, but a good time for a not totally dumb movie."
Reno,"> Two women's efforts from two different timelines to save their loved one.

It was in the pre-production for over a decade, before reshuffle and recasting happened with the existing one. It was supposed to be an Indo-Aussie joint production, but later the Belgium production company joined the project. After the several hurdles it managed to get completed. It was an Anglo-Indian historical romance-drama, during the British raj in India about betrayal, coup, revenge and a journey movie. Also simultaneously set in the modern world focusing an archaeological couple who discovers a lost ancient Indian jewel in a shipwreck. From there the story gets a perfect beginning, later moves back to India.

I don't understand what's with the Chinese music where the actual story take place in the 18th century India. It was so good and blends well, but that does define India or Indian culture while narrating its story. If you are not familiar with both Chinese and Indian musics, then it's not an issue at all. But that does not it, the names are Hindu and Indian soldiers with the Persian costumes, swords and other gadgets.

How the name 'Dragon's Throat' came to Indian geographical area and surname for the Indian characters in a wrong princely state. Like that, many stuffs make no sense, especially if you are from that part of the Earth. I think the research was very poor for making this movie. They should have hired an Indian musician and costume designer with an historian.

> ""Love has many faces,
> and one of them is jealousy.""

The quality was top notch, the cast and their performances were excellent. But I could not stand for Bipasha Basu's facial expressions. She was always been in a sad face look, so depressing. That is the way her character was developed, so nothing wrong in her display. It was her international debut flick as well, and the launch was so disappointing. Because the story was very weak, maybe very silly. I have never seen the narration set in the ancient India other than in the Indian films. Quite amazing locations, and convinced with the visuals that how the 1700s' subcontinent would have looked like.

The major problem with this flick is that people can't get ending. How the time barrier was broken to pass through another timeline was never explained. The Hindu priest/saint/sadhu who blabbers about the space and time was a ridiculous than intellectual briefing. So this film owes lots of explanation to the viewers than entertaining them. I want to favour it, but I also want to be honest. The film was not like I was hoping for, very excited for the merge of historical subject with sci-fi, but did not stand tall. Thankfully, either it was not a bad movie of the year, I've seen even worse that I felt not to review. I won't recommend it, but there's a slim chance that you might like it, so choose it carefully.

Per Gunnar Jonsson,"I had some expectations on this movie. Samurai’s, fantasy, magic etc… Sounds good to me alright. Well, as it turned out after having watched it I feel that my expectations was not entirely fulfilled. It is a decent enough movie. Certainly enjoyable to watch. But it is, in my opinion, not a great move and I cannot give it more than an average okay rating.

I have not read the original story which the movie is, supposedly, based nor seen any of the other 47 Ronin movies that have been made. Thus I did not really know what the story was except what was the public storyline nor do I know if the movie actually follows the original story in any great detail. The basic story in the movie is a good one though. Classic, simple and perhaps not very original but a good concept for making a good adventure movie.

The movie is entertaining…to an extent. There are plenty of nice scenes, action, special effects that all make the movie worthwhile to watch. The Japanese, samurai, setting is one that is not used very often in major movies except of course for a bunch of fairly ludicrous martial arts movies which cater for a rather limited audience and generally on a very low-budget.

However, I never really felt much attachment to any of the characters. Even the half-breed, which are supposed to be the hero, never seemed to lift above the ordinary. The bad guy could have been any two-bit crook in a TV-show. The witch was a bit better but still rather meh. The Shogun at least provoked a bit of emotions but not in a good way. What an asshole! Not a shred of investigation when Lord Asano was bewitched. Just “go kill yourself”. Then after the 47 Ronins had actually proven his innocence as well as proven themselves to be the most loyal and capable warriors around the dumb fuck wants them killed because they disobeyed his orders which where total nonsense from the start. As a matter of fact, the ending dragged down the movie quite a lot for me.

Still a movie worth watching but it could have been a lot better."
Andres Gomez,"I didn't have much expectations for this movie but it was enjoyable enough. Maybe it has some holes that were created to appeal the action movies viewer. I also ""borrows"" without shame from ""Princess Mononoke"" and other movies but, as a whole, it is decent enough."
Raquel98,This movie is very good I loved it so much.
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"This is indeed a great piece of superhero entertainment. If superheroes and action, plenty of action, is within your sphere of interest then this movie truly delivers. There is even a story to support the stunts and special effects fireworks that is not too shabby. As a matter of fact, for being a Marvel-based movie, the story is more than acceptable.

As the blurb states, our hero is meeting a few adaptation issues after having been awaken into the modern world. Luckily the movie do not fall into the trap of making some silly comedy out of it but keeps these parts at a reasonable level where it stays funny without ruining the movie or disrupting the pace of the real story.

The story? Simple and not very original with the usual slew of traitors strewn about, you cannot trust anyone, our hero becomes a fugitive etc etc bla bla bla. It is however a pretty straightforward one which works quite well and is not getting bogged down in silly emotions and general idiotic behavior by our hero like for instance several instalments of Spider Man have done. Actually this is one thing that I really like with this movie. The hero is a true hero from start to finish without any of that modern Hollywood crap where the hero must be tarnished in one way or another to satisfy the directors and producers.

As I wrote above if you like superhero action movies then there is little not to like with this one. Acceptable story, plenty of action, good special effects, a cool chick (hey I am but an ordinary male, I like female actors in tight costumes) and a clear hero. None of the actors are really doing a bad job of it and in general the acting is as good as one can expect when portraying characters that, after all, are be totally ludicrous in real life. Its 8 out of 10 rating at IMDb (at the time of writing this) is well deserved. I am astonished that some people seem to have voted it down with a one star rating. It is a Marvel-based movie. You might feel it is more or less good but the style of the movie should not really be a major surprise to anyone and there is no way in hell that it deserves a one star rating unless someone really watched the wrong movie by accident."
Andres Gomez,"Put *a little* bit of brain in a superhero's movie script and you will have everybody talking wonders about it.

This is not a bad movie but neither astonishing. Fun and entertaining and with great FX, as expected."
Grant English,"The Winter Soldier has all the action, quirky one-liners, and bold adventure that we have come to expect of a Marvel movie.

Plus we get introduced to a new/old villain as well as some fun romantic tension between Steve Rogers (Captain America) and Natasha Romanoff (The Black Widow).  (Scarlett Johansson is perfect in this role.)

But this film also has some minor irritations all stemming from Marvel's tendency to make _Captain America_ more complicated than it really needs to be.

MINOR SPOILER ALERT:
1. The love story/non-story.  Is this necessary? Will the Captain remain faithful to a 80 year-old woman on her deathbed OR engage in a date with his next door neighbor?  Plus the tension between him and Natasha Romanoff is intense.  This comes off as forced, awkward, and pointless.

2. “The deception goes deeper than you can imagine. You can’t trust anybody.”  It's this way every time so it should no longer be a surprise.

3. He’s dead but not really. Not him, the other him. Well…they both were dead – not really – but now they are both alive. But one of them can’t remember who he really is. In this film we get to do this with two characters instead of one.  It’s not a huge distraction but why does Marvel keep returning to this plot line? 

END OF MINOR SPOILER ALERT

The Winter Soldier is best when Rogers and Romanoff are on the move trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together. The explosions are nice, the action scenes are intense but the real enjoyment of the film is where skill and wits are relied on more than gadgets and explosions. 

Patriotism is a bit more nuanced this time around and it's better for it.  The cast is great, no awkward acting moments to report. It’s a great summer flick with all the action you want."
John Chard,"Till the end of the road.

Stonking! Now this is more like it, after the disappointments that have been Iron Man 2 and Thor 2, Captain America gets a sequel of substance and sparks. It manages to blend everything required to make a great superhero film, lashings of derring-do heroics, action bonanza, adventure, some sexy sizzle and of course the key, a story with brains and mystery elements.

True enough to say that the considerable contributions of Black Widow and Falcon (and Nick Fury of course) keeps this as a lively Avengers spin-off movie, which is no bad thing at all, but it's still the Captain who dominates things, marking himself out as a viable main man. In fact the whole film has the old school comic book feel, yes there's the grandiose pyrotechnics - unsurprisingly amped up for the big finale, but there's an adherence to serial thriller conventions that is, well, rather warm and comforting.

With the Captain getting some surprising amount of emotional depth and humanity courtesy of the perfectly cast Chris Evans, the viewers have much to care about. Themes of Bondian world domination and global security crisis keep things nice and fanciful, while the unheralded work by the effects guys is modern cinematic art. There's some adherence to genre formula, and a bit of Marvel universe copy-catting going on, but this is one of the best films from the Marvel stable. A rich sequel indeed - more Captain America please. 9/10"
Gimly,"**A long format review from 2014**

Misleadingly, the titular Winter Soldier is essentially a minor subplot in what is more of an espionage-technoir-thriller meets spectacle-epic than your typical super hero film. The real meat of the movie, thankfully, has some more substance behind it. Though it wouldn't surprise me if we learn later that Sebastian Stan's villain was forced to take a back seat via last minute script changes à la Hawkeye in _The Avengers_.

These things are of course a matter of opinion, and I'd like to watch _Winter Soldier_ at least once more (particularly in 2D... God do I ever hate 3D) before committing to any particular ranking. But even without that, I feel confident in saying it's the best MCU Phase 2 film to date. We must await _Guardians of The Galaxy_ and _Age of Ultron_ before cementing that little award, but I'd say that it stands at the very least above _Iron Man 3_ and _The Dark World_.

I always try to keep my reviews spoiler free, but being that in most parts of the world it isn't out yet, I'll be extra careful to do so with this one. This makes talking about _Winter Soldier_ on its own merits difficult, but there are certainly a few things that can be said.

Chris Evans (Cap'), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) and to a slightly lesser extent. Anthonie Mackie (Falcon) rule the film, and do so without any shortcomings. That's not to say that they couldn't physically have done any better, but their roles were all seamless as far as my blurred vision could tell, which is not an accolade I'd often give.

Where _The Dark World_ was simply a holding pattern for Thor with some very pretty pictures, _Iron Man 3_ and _The Winter Soldier_ went out and took some actual risks in their stories. But unlike _Iron Man 3's_, Winter Soldier's risks have (to its eternal credit) been universally well received.

Directors Joe and Anthony Russo also managed to cameo a couple of Community alumni, which will never be a bad thing in my eyes, even if they're just one-off, throwaway jokes.

As I said, I really feel I need to give _The Winter Soldier_ at the very least one more screening before I feel totally confident in my thoughts about it.

But the fact that I'm really fucking excited for that second viewing speaks in its favour if nothing else does.

tmdb44006625,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier opens up with an action sequence that's better than most action movie climaxes. It then sets up a really intriguing story before launching into one of the most suspenseful car chases since the Simpson/Bruckheimer 90s era. After that it's scene after scene of amazing action coupled with a complex story about heroes and villains being caught in a system that is too big to bring down, unless you're as good and level headed as Steve Rogers.

This isn't just a great comic book movie. It's a great movie; period. Using a spy thriller style mixed with martial arts and gunplay, set to the perfect music score, I would rank The Winter Soldier as one of my favourite action films hands down."
JPV852,"Third time seeing this and still a fantastic all-around film, not just a comic book movie either. Briskly paced and a great complex story, this is a Marvel movie that felt complete from beginning to end, and actually advanced the universe so well. Chris Evans continues to embody the role and nice to see Scarlett Johansson given more to do (up to the point of this film's release) than in Iron Man 2 or The Avengers. **4.75/5**

I probably rate this right alongside The Dark Knight amongst comic book movies and, saying this as a DC fan, perhaps edges out TDK (though could easily seeing roles reversed once I re-watch that one)."
r96sk,"Entertaining!

<em>'Captain America: The Winter Soldier'</em> makes for an enjoyable flick. Chris Evans does great work as the lead character, while Scarlett Johansson gives her most fun to watch performance in the MCU up until this point; it would've been great if she had such a role pre-<em>'The Avengers'</em>, so she wouldn't have felt so out of place to me in that.

Anthony Mackie and Robert Redford are notable in their respective roles, as is Sebastian Stan - even if, to be honest, his character's connection with the lead didn't quite hit as hard as the film attempts - at least for me. I didn't really believe how his character came about and how Barnes acts throughout, Stan does well though. Samuel L. Jackson is also good.

Everything else is exactly what you'd expect from a film of this size. Great effects, entertaining action and a satisfying story. Very good, all in all."
CinemaSerf,"Picking up from his rather frosty denouement of 2011, ""Capt. America"" (Chris Evans) finds himself seventy years older but still with battles to fight. This time, he teams up with ""Nick Fury"" (Samuel L. Jackson) and his SHIELD agent ""Natasha"" (Scarlet Johansson) to combat the ruthless warrior known only as the ""Winter Soldier"". It doesn't take us long to discover that there is quite conspiracy going on too - with an attempt on the life of ""Fury"" before off we go on a roller-coaster ride of action adventure scenarios. The effects are great and the score works well to help keep the break-neck pace working well and excitingly. Evans is still just a little too pretty-boy for me, but the developing roles of Anthony Mackie, Johansson and a few cameos from the somewhat duplicitous ""Pierce"" (Robert Redford) all contribute well to make this a superior adventure film with a strong and characterful story underpinning it. It hasn't quite the charm of the first film, so I wouldn't say it is better - but it is certainly just as good, and as with the first outing, the 2¼ hours just flies by. Great cinema."
John Chard,"Dreamworks play safe and sign the series off with dignity.

After the monstrosity that was Shrek the Turd, the Dreamworks team behind the Shrek franchise woke up and realised what made the series so popular in the first place. Shrek Forever After is not a particularly great film, but it finds some firm footings to appease the adults and children alike.

Thematically it's as safe as houses, it pitches Shrek into a ""It's a Wonderful Life"" scenario, where the big green ogre gets to spend a day away from the life he didn't realise he was happy with in the first place. Making a deal with the nefarious Rumpelstiltskin, Shrek finds a world of darkness for ogres, a world ruled by a psychotic who has an army of flying Margaret Hamilton's to do his bidding. Worse than that, Fiona doesn't know him, she's the leader of the resistance and has no time for some big green ogre love. Donkey is all mangy and Puss in Boots literally has become a fat cat, it's a horrible life, man!

The action and graphics whizz past the eyes in what is a perfectly pitched time frame of 90 minutes. It never reaches the heights of the first two movies, but it doesn't strain for laughs or narrative cheek (Pied Piper as a bounty hunter? Genius), or more crucially, it's never dull, something part 3 can't safely claim to not be. It bows out with head held high, not so much in a blaze of glory, but with a dignified recognition of the fact it's time to retire to the swamp and chill out. Take it easy Shrek and the gang. 7/10"
ohlalipop,"Didn't really want to watch this. I mean, 4th movie??? Please stop already. But then it's hot and we have nothing else to do so ok. Shrek it is. 


The story is a little bit of continuation from the Shrek trilogy. But then of course, the story was crazy, going back to the past just so they can have a story from it and make another movie from it. Just seeing the trailers always make me say ""Please stop making Shrek movies."" But after seeing this movie I realized, I was entertained. It still had those funny moments although the first 3 were definitely funnier than this one. 


My rate for this movie is B+."
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"I have to say that I quite enjoyed Tomorrowland despite its way too common mistake of being quite a bit nonsensically preachy to satisfy the current politically correct view of what is “wrong” with the world today. Filtering out those parts this is a quite enjoyable, visually very entertaining, family movie. If you have strong opinions about certain things then you might want to be with your kids when watching this one. Personally I consider my oldest son to be quite capable of making his own opinions and as for the two younger kinds I try to point out the pro’s and con’s and let them grow up to make their own mistakes.

Having that out of the way this is a visually quite wonderful movie. it is of course quite CGI enhanced but in a good way. It is a Disney movie after all so you would expect, at least I did, some “artistic freedom” as far as the scenery is concerned.

The story is actually a quite lovely “fairy tale” kind of story about a “wonderland” far far away. Initially it is a wee bit difficult to get a grip of what is happening since it all moves about all over the place a bit. If you can overcome that first disorientation it does indeed get somewhat sensible after a while. Having said that I mean “sensible” in the context of not only a wild and whacky science fiction movie but in the context of a wild and wacky science fiction movie aimed at the younger part of the audience. Despite the scientific blurb thrown around in the last half of the movie do not for a minute believe that any of the script writers have more scientific knowledge than the average Hollywood script writer which is…zero.

To me the enjoyment of this movie came from the childish fantasy style (it does have quite a bit of a fairly tale story over it), from the rather enjoyable cinematic effects, quite a bit of cool action and last but not least … George Clooney. Actually that is not entirely fair. George was part of it but what I really liked was the recruiting android all the way from the start. When Clooney entered the scene both him and the android pretty much stole the scene. I am afraid that the Newton girl, for a lot of the time, felt more like a “plot element” than a main character to me.

I have to say that I quite liked the scenes in Paris as well. Sorry guys but I do live in France after all. The Eiffel Tower scenes where quite enjoyable and I do like the touch where they used Mr. Eiffel’s apartment at the top of the tower as a scenery. Actually I am not sure how many people actually know that there is an apartment (now a museum) up there. The stuff about a hidden room and a hidden [naah, that would be a spoiler] beneath the tower is of course truly nonsensical.

So, bottom line, if Disney would not have gone down the line of trying to make a political statement, and I do not care what that statement was except that it was blunt, obvious and unconcealed, then this movie would have gotten another star or two. I cannot justify giving it much lower than what I did since it was, technically speaking, a quite good and entertaining movie. However, movies for children is not the medium to make a statement unless you believe that you are living in a socialist state a ‘la the Soviet Union."
r96sk,"Wish it was greater, but for what it is it's still enjoyable.

<em>'Tomorrowland'</em> is an intriguing futuristic film, it doesn't really delve as deep into its potential-filled premise as it should but it scratches the surface and it makes for - just about - solid viewing. The special effects are very nice, also.

As for the casting, I guess it could've been better. However, I did like the main quartet of Britt Robertson (Casey), George Clooney (Frank), Raffey Cassidy (Athena) and Hugh Laurie (David) - the latter has a good rant late on. I rate the way the story is told, mostly in retrospective by Robertson and Clooney - it keeps it interesting.

I just feel more should've been done with this, given it's fairly entertaining even in its current state and has a load of potential. Either way, I did narrowly like it."

JonathanGreen,Smartness overload! The technology and talents of all the characters were beyond my comprehension. GENIUS!
r96sk,"Cool animated superhero film, one that I think is good.

There are moments I like about <em>'Big Hero 6'</em> and moments I don't like quite as much. I'll start with the positive parts. The animation is excellent, as is the music (nice song from Fall Out Boy). It also has a fair amount of heart, not as much as the film intends to add but still more than most.

Now for the lesser things; that aren't bad per se, just not as well done in my opinion. The plot doesn't feel like anything too refreshing, I feel it's a story I've mostly seen elsewhere; in a few areas  it kinda reminded me of the sorta stuff you'd see in a Scooby Doo episode, at least in terms of the twists and/or antagonists. I, also, don't love the design for Baymax - making a character with no facial expressions or true emotion always makes it harder to get attached to them. I do like his purpose, mind.

As for the cast, they're decent just not memorable to me. Ryan Potter and Daniel Henney are solid as Hiro and Tadashi, I enjoy their bond together. I'm struggling to remember any of the others though.

All in all, a good film - it's just missing a couple of things that would've made it greater."
GeekMasher,"Wreck-It Ralph is a great movie with my love for games in there with it. The movie had some great childhood memories of mine, with all the characters from the best games. The graphics are excellent and the voice acting couldn't be better. This movie is great for adults and kids."
Andres Gomez,Surely the thematic is great and it is funny to see old pals from several video games but Wreck-it Ralph lacks the hook of most of Disney movies.
r96sk,"Thoroughly enjoyable.

<em>'Wreck-It Ralph'</em> is very good. At the beginning it feels as if it might just be a video game rehash of <em>'Toy Story'</em>. However, pleasingly, it does its own thing as it gives a positive message and has more than satisfactory humour.

I'm never been a proper gamer, at least not in the sphere of games used here, but I still got a load of the little references. I also like how the world is built, it's silly sure but it's still pretty neat how they tie it all together.

John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman are excellent in their roles as Ralph and Vanellope. It's very easy to care for those two characters, with both having meaningful stories. Jane Lynch (Calhoun), Jack McBrayer (Felix) and Alan Tudyk (Candy) add to the film with their characters - it's clear to see the ode (copy?) to Ed Wynn and his Mad Hatter for Tudyk's role.

The animation is nice, while the music - though not memorable at all - is rather catchy and suits the Sugar Rush surroundings in particular. Give it a watch."
Wuchak,"***Some kids with creepy dead eyes take a dreamlike trip to the North Pole on The Polar Express*** 

A boy from Grand Rapids, Michigan, is at the age where he no longer believes in Christmas, as far as Santa, his elves and flying reindeer go, but a magical train appears in front of his home on Christmas Eve and whisks him away on an adventurous trip to the North Pole with several other kids.

“The Polar Express” (2004) was based on the 1985 Christmas book and was the first mainline movie to use motion capture animation for all its characters beginning to end (think Gollum from “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy). Some people think the animation is weak, but I feel it creates its own world and has its own charm. It holds up as long as you can adapt to those creepy dead eyes of the characters.

Some people love this movie while others think it’s weird, like a Twilight Zone Christmas flick. Roger Ebert, for instance, loved it and gave it a perfect grade. I’m sorta in the middle. I see its good points and appreciate them, like the haunting winter ambiance, parts of the trip to the North Pole (e.g. the quasi-rollercoaster ride) and the kids’ investigation of the Christmas factory. But there are some meh parts and dubious sections like the whole last act with the multitude of elves and the towering Santa who looked like he was modeled after 6’5” Christopher Lee with a pillow strapped to his mid-section.

The movie’s interesting in some ways but also quaint in a cheesy way, as well as peculiar and lifeless.

The film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes.

GRADE: C"
Peter89Spencer,"No matter how many times I watch this, it always brought me to tears!

I only wish that I got to see it in 3D at the cinema."
Peter McGinn,"Watching The Polar Express is not an annual event for me, but I believe I have seen it three times and would not nix the idea if someone were to suggest watching it again.  I feel a connection to it for an odd reason: my wife and I volunteered one Christmas season to be elves serving cocoa and dancing for an actual Polar Express narrow gauge train ride when we lived in Maine. (Though I can assure you our dancing was not as acrobatic as what you see in this movie.)

The animation feels a little odd at first, but I stop noticing it each time I watch it. The story turns the train trip to the North Pole into a real thrill ride for the children on board, especially for our hero boy, voiced by Tom Hanks. In fact, if you are a Hanks fan, settle in, because he does multiple voices here, including one that sounds remarkably like Gilbert Godfrey to me.

I try to avoid punching holes in the plots of Christmas movies. Half the point is that they will include unlikely events all leading to the miracle of Christmas ending. You want logic; pull out the old algebra textbook!"
CinemaSerf,"A young man is all excited as he heads to bed on Christmas eve. His sleep is disturbed though, when his house starts to shake.

Safely aboard he encounters other children and adventure beckons as they learn that one child will get to meet Santa Claus himself before he embarks on his global deliveries! I didn't love this film. I found the rather sharp, linear, facial animations a bit too sterile and there is way too much chatter with not enough going on. I can play chase the ticket once, but after a while that became little better than a clunky conduit for the rather episodic nature of the narrative. I'm sure that technically it is a masterpiece of CGI and human interaction, but somehow it all just left me feeling that the cheesy sentiment overwhelmed it with it's messages of teamwork and the Christmas spirit well and truly over-egged. Alan Silvestri has provided a nice score, and when the animation scenes focus on the actual train then it does liven up a bit, but sorry - for the most part I wasn't sold."

Reno,"**The earthlings are united to defend the home from another alien attack.**

I have said it many times that when I love a film, I always pray for a sequel to come. But I won't do that for all the films like perhaps 'Taken' and this one. These are not designed for that kind of a stretch or to own a franchise. So anyway they have made it and I'd watched. Since I was not expecting it, I did not care about the how it ends. I mean critically failed and the box office was okay, but did not meet the expectations. I mean not found anywhere near to the original film's collection.

For me, minus half point for the Chinese flavour. I think the Hollywood must stop leaning towards Chinese contents. It is like they are ignoring the rest of the world. I want the old days American films, not this yuan targeted films. Sorry, that is one of the reasons why I disliked films like this, 'Now You See Me 2' and many other recent sino-Hollywood films.

This story takes place 20 years later to the original film. Only a handful of characters returned and many of them were new. So now the humans leaped forward after adapting the alien technology. But when they learn the distress call was sent to the base of the enemy from the 20 years ago event, they are underprepared for another alien attack that follows very soon. Without any option they push their full force to defend the earth and it would they succeed or not is what the remaining film to reveal.

Nowadays the graphics are not an issue. The filmmaking had touched down for a standard in the visual quality, especially a big production like this. So those parts even overplay the performances of the real actors. We have seen that from Gollum, King Kong and many other monster films. So if you are watching a today's high end film means, it is a pleasure from the blow ups we expect the most. Similar to killings from the horror thrillers. This film does that so well, that mean it is entertaining, but not the overall film very praisable.

This story can be easily connected to many classics such as 'Star Wars' and 'Avatar'. Because how it ends seems like a story about the origins of those films. So the third film is like definitely takes us deep into the space. Looks very interesting, but does it work is the real question. It is already in the work with the same director. So lets wait and see how it corrects its mistakes. Meantime, you can watch this if you haven't yet, but it is an average film.

_5.5/10_"
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"Independence Day: Resurgence is pretty much what I expected. Actually, given all the negative reviews floating around, it is almost better than what I expected. As is almost always the case, all the 1 and 2 star ratings and “worst movie ever” reviews are pure bullshit. The biggest advantage the original movie had was the novelty of it all. This movie is really pretty much the same except for the special effects being even bigger to the extent that they are somewhat over the top at times and the plot somewhat thinner. Having said the latter, the original movie did not really have much in terms of plot either and the nonsense of giving a totally alien computer a virus was so bad it really dragged down the movie.

In the relatively short timespan of two decades humanity have improved their technology base by several orders of magnitude (ray guns on the moon etc. etc…). The speed of improvement is of course pretty unrealistic, even with access to alien technology, but hey, I can live with that in order to increase the coolness factor of the movie.

Then comes an alien ship. Not the aliens we all expected by another one. The ship is totally different from the previous ones, do not seem aggressive but of course dumbass politicians manage to screw everything up. Fast forward a couple of scenes and the “real” aliens arrive. Of course this time they have a bigger flyswatter and they perfunctorily proceed to swat away the puny, extremely slow firing, little ray guns of the humans and we are back to where we started in the original movie. Huge space ship parks on Earth, time for plan B.

Well there were quite a few scenes of big space ships, destruction and mayhem before the aliens finally manage to park their spaceship. I guess finding a parking space for a 5 000 kilometer space ship can be a bit tricky (I though I had an issue with my Jeep). Here is were I have quite some gripes about the movie. The special effects are cool, no question about it, but they are also exaggerated and throws any attempt to be remotely adhering to the laws of physics out the window. It is clear that whatever low intelligence storywriter that wrote that garbage flunked science classes in school, if he ever got that far of course. For instance, we have a 5 000 kilometer (the Earth radius is about 6 370 kilometer) that is big enough to generate its own gravity (apparently the engines somehow contributed to this) flies in and lands on earth. When it approaches items on the surface, cars, trains, ships, skyscrapers and bits and pieces of the Earth itself starts to fly upwards. It makes for cool effects but anyone with a mediocrum of intelligence ought to realize that such a force would actually destabilize Earth itself. Possibly change the speed of rotation as well as the orbit around the sun.

The story is full of other typical Hollywood stupidities and plot holes. Christ even my kids could spot the plot holes which were often big enough to drive a battleship through!

As for the acting. Well, I would say there is not too much to say about it. Most of the main actors managed to make it through the movie without screwing up too badly. Given that it was not the deepest or thought provoking movie one could imagine I would say that was good enough. The best character in my opinion was Judd Hirsch as Julius Levinson. The worst one was probably Dr. Okun. Not that Brent Spiner was making a bad job of representing him but the character was just to crazed out for my taste.

Okay, I will stop whining now. This movie was pretty much exactly what I expected. Great special effects tied together with a paper thin story. I went into it hoping that the effects were going to be good with little expectations on the rest and that is exactly what I got. The movie fulfilled my expectations completely and thus I consider it worth 7 out of 10 stars. I enjoyed the two hours watching it."
ohlalipop,"So the movie was great. I wasn't expecting it to be that good actually. I thought it will be one of those movies wherein it turns out just okay because it's not a Disney/Pixar movie. I mean....if it's not a Disney/Pixar movie, don't expect anything. Which was good I think because not expecting turned out great for me. 


It was very entertaining (aside from the noisy children and a very noisy and loud mom behind us). I know Toby will like this movie (he actually was able to watch it from beginning to end...for the first time). There's just so much to see. And the ending. Such a tragic ending but it's still a happy ending don't worry.


My rate for this movie is A. Good for kids. Good for adults."
trineo03,"First of all, the animation in this is spectacular. All the scenery in the film looks like something you could find in real life. The action, mainly the climax, and flying shots in this film also show how great the animation is. The main thing about the animation that is amazing is how the dragons look. They all look like real, kinda cartoonish, dragons that come across as vicious but also cute. The cinematography in this film is stunning. The lighting in each and every scene was chosen correctly for it. I really like the score in this film that was done by John Powell. The music in the film just helped bring you into this fantasy world of Vikings and dragons. Now my main problem is mainly the casting of the voice actors. They all did great jobs as their roles but I think some of them would have been better casted if their character was older and not a teenager. That can mainly be seen with Hiccup who is supposed to be a teenager but sounds like an adult who already went through puberty. I also had a few issues with the pacing in this film. Some scenes were way too short and I would have liked to have seen them a tiny bit longer. Now I do get that it’s a film made for children but as long as there’s moving objects on screen kids won’t care what’s happening in the movie. In the end How to Train Your Dragon is an excellent film for everybody no matter how old you are. I give How to Train Your Dragon a 9/10."
tmdb44006625,"Who wouldn't want Toothless as a pet?

Honestly I can see my future kids and their future kids loving this movie as much as I do. How To Train Your Dragon is just that great of a movie. It's gorgeous, funny, heartfelt, and it's got something to say. I can't praise this wonderful film enough."
primeos,"# My favorite movie

IMO it simply has it all: Action, fun, love, nice animations and CGI, an amazing soundtrack, a good story, etc."
DRDMovieMusings,"SPOILERS 

Under-rated, worthy chapter to the story, with surprisingly provocative ideas and some stellar acting.

While this movie admittedly has neither the grit of T1 nor the grand vision or pathos of T2, I'd like to share what I believe to be three elements which together cement T3's place in the canon of the Terminator franchise.

The first is the way the actors acted the relationship between Connor and the T-800. While Connor has memories that we the audience recall from T2, the T-800, played by Arnold, was not the same T-800 from T2. This is just another machine from off an assembly line of T-800s that were manufactured. Yeah, Arnold looks like Arnold, but this T-800 has no memory of the previous installment because it was not there. And he acts disconnected, distant and mechanical, betraying zero connection to Connor. That was really cool, and helped we the audience appreciate that, where the T-800 comes from, is a much bigger place than we had heretofore really digested. We only ever saw one or two at a time back in our time; the reality we had not yet seen by the time of T3, is that the future was full of these things, and there's nothing personal about them. We the audience wanted to reconnect to all the good feelings from the end of T2, we wanted to get personal with these machines, and that's really hard to do. This movie smacked us back to ""reality"".

The second aspect is that this is the movie that puts the transition to SkyNet into a context that we could see. Now we know why and how the government handed control over to SkyNet. T3 displayed what we'd heard a little about in T1, and a little more about in T2, but it did so in a way that did not prompt much in the way of ""where did that come from?"" or ""what are they talking about"" that I've ever come across (Terminator Salvation failed test this miserably, spectacularly).

The third and final aspect of the movie that, for me, was rather provocative is that, right up to the end, we the audience are following the stubborn view of Connor that judgment day can be stopped. He was sure they'd stopped it at the end of T2. He was sure they were racing to stop it throughout T3...but, if we the audience stopped ourselves from being emotionally carried away, we'd have come to the realization Connor did earlier that judgment day could not be stopped. The terminators kept coming back from the future because the technology had advanced to where it was both possible and necessary. So judgment day did happen, and the terminator being there meant it couldn't be stopped.

Is T3 the best in the franchise? Heck no! C'mon, I'm not totally crazy. Is it the worst? I don't think so, at all. (I, personally, lay that crown on Terminator Salvation, but I digress...) T2 is the best, for me, for a few reasons. T1 is the honourable second because it started the story and set up many of the devices that would help make T2 among the great sequals of all time - right up there with Godfather 2 and Star Wars Episode 2, and Blade II :-)"
Gimly,"The worst _Terminator_ movie. Which seeing as what came after it is... Quite the burn.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
CinemaSerf,"Is it in the song ""American Pie"" where Don McLean sings ""Fire is the Devil's only friend""? Well, I hate to contradict him, but I am afraid time travel is also one of his allies - especially when it is handled in quite such a derivative fashion as this. This time Arnie returns from the future to protect the under-the-radar drifter ""Connor"" (Nick Stahl) and his as yet unknown, future, wife ""Kate"" (Claire Danes) from another, much more state of the art ""Terminator"" - the ""T-X"" (Kristanna Loken). The plot thickens when we discover that her father is an US Air Force general in charge of an whole load of military tech and that baddies Skynet hope to be able to manipulate the past and take control of the defences leaving the nation open to attack from even more of their deadly machines. Could they be re-inventing their own future - on their own, dastardly, terms? Well, of course the original T-1000 (our friendly, neighbourhood, ""Terminator"") is determined to work with ""Connor"" and the now remarkably adept with weaponry ""Kate"" to ensure that this catastrophe is thwarted. Nope, there is not the slightest amount of menace or jeopardy here at all. You might as well just watch the last ten minutes and confirm what you knew was going to happen from the start of this completely unnecessary sequel. The horse has been well and truly flogged; the action scenes - though impressive enough on the VFX front - are all repetitively predictable and frankly rather dull. Neither Stahl nor Danes really fit into their roles particularly well, and strong as he is, Mr. Schwarzenegger can only do so much of the heavy lifting before even his broad shoulders get too tired to prop the whole thing up. Mark Famiglietti provides a bit of eye candy, but otherwise this is all poorly written and delivered, forgettable, stuff that just about passes OK the time in front of the telly."
Binawoo,This movie was so AWESOME! I loved it all and i had a bad day before watching it but it turned it around. I love action packed movies and this was great.
Andres Gomez,"Really funny and with great spcial effects. Probably, one of the movies not to miss this year."
Eazyryda,I ΛM GЯӨӨƬ!
Grant English,"This was a pleasant surprise of a movie, full of great humor as well as an intriguing story.  It's quick and zany at times.  Think <em>Psych</em> in space (back when Psych was funny).  The pace is quick and the story line is easy to pick up and follow.

What makes the film work is something that early Lucas and Joss Whedon understand:  great sci-fi movies are really westerns at heart.  There is a relationship with nature, a broken, compromised hero, a deep necessity for teamwork, and the story happens OUT there in the wild.  <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> has ALL of this.  

<em>Guardians</em> is already set up for a sequel so we will see if Marvel can continue the magic.  It's a great addition to the Marvel universe."
Travis Bell,"Like most of the reviews here, I agree that Guardians of the Galaxy was an absolute hoot. Guardians never takes itself too seriously which makes this movie a whole lot of fun.

The cast was perfectly chosen and even though two of the main five were CG, knowing who voiced and acted alongside them completely filled out these characters.

Guardians of the Galaxy is one of those rare complete audience pleasers. Good fun for everyone!"
djgri,"The thing about this film when I first saw it, was the incredible juxtaposition of sadness, humor and courage. Great acting! The music is superb. That Sony Walkman must be the best bit of brand advertising ever engaged by a company within a film. The film should appeal to a broad range of viewers."
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"This movie is more of a comedy than anything else. It is truly a comic magazine brought to life on the big screen and more focused on delivering a sequence of action scenes and laughs than anything intelligent in the form of plot or characters. I would say it is a movie for the younger audience and comic fans. Having said that I must admit that I found it rather fun to watch.

The main characters are two mostly irresponsible rascals, one dumb but likable living tree and two fanatics of which one certainly need not apply to the Mensa club. Of the five I liked Rocket and Gamora the best. Rocket is a rather likable rascal and Gamora is simply cool. Quill is sometimes just silly, Groot is more of a living prop and Drax is just too stupid.

The story is more or less just there to tie the scenes together. Unfortunately we do really not get much of a background to the Guardians of The Galaxy universe. It would have been nice to get a bit more understanding of why things are as they are etc. The return of this movie is watching the action, the special effects and the laughs. It is an action-adventure-comedy plain and simple. If you approach it as such it works reasonably well.

Speaking of special effects, they are generally well done. The designs are interesting. The shape of the bad guys spaceship is totally ludicrous of course but visually pleasing and goes with the rest of the movie’s tendency to be more of a comedy than a serious movie. The same can be said for that cool but weird net they made by interlinking fighter crafts.

On the whole an entertaining movie. I have to say that the dancing scene at the end was a wee bit too silly for me though. I have a problem understanding how a movie like this can get such a relatively high rating at IMDb but okay it was fun to watch and it is not entirely undeserved. Personally I think a 7 out of 10 is more in the right region.

Gimly,"**A long form review originally posted n 2014:**

Now that I’ve given _Guardians_ a BluRay watch through, I feel more comfortable reviewing it. I saw it on the first day of its Australian cinematic release, but I wasn’t sure what I thought. I watched it again and still wasn’t sure, but now that it’s six months later, I am sure.

I’m a massive fan of director James Gunn. Come to think of it, I’m also also a big fan of Lee Pace, Michael Rooker, Chris Pratt, Benicio Del Toro, Djimon Honsou, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Peter Serafinowicz, Alexis Denisof, Rob Zombie and Nathan Fillion, and they’re all in this. Not to mention I’m an absolute sucker for the MCU. So after hearing that a very decent chunk of the fanbase thinking that not only was this the best Marvel film of the year (going up against _Winter Soldier_ and _Days of Future Past_), but that they would then go on to say it was the best Marvel Cinematic Universe film ever, you could imagine I was very surprised to find that I actually didn’t think it was all that great.

I don’t want people thinking I didn’t like it. I did. In fact I will go on record saying that it was miles away from their worst film, and if I’m being honest they handled the last 25 minutes (arguably the most important part) of the film absolutely spectacularly. But I didn’t get the magic that everyone was telling me about. How this was the film for the new generation.  I didn’t even get the sense of satisfaction that I had in Cap’s movie just a few months previous.

So many things seemed under utilised, but I don’t know what you could have cut to make room for the extra things I wanted. Which means the only way to get it is to have a longer film. It’s already two hours, and a longer movie means a bigger budget and less screenings. ie. more money going out and less money coming in. And at the end of the day Disney is a business, and they have to make their money the best way they think they can. So I understand why it wasn’t perfect for me, but that doesn’t stop me from feeling _Guardians_ is a mite overrated. Good damn movie. But overrated.

Personally I’d stick it somewhere in the middle of the MCU’s releases thus far. Leaps and bounds above _The Incredible Hulk_, _The Dark World_ and _Iron Man 2_, but not so beloved as the likes of _The Avengers_, _Winter Soldier_ or _Iron Man 1_.

tmdb44006625,"Guardians of the Galaxy is a gorgeous and wonderfully entertaining space opera. The characters are so damn lovable, the world building is incredible, the soundtrack gives the film an entirely unique feel, and the effects are astoundingly first rate.

The story follows the pattern of the space fantasies that influenced George Lucas, but the presentation is the work of the extraordinarily gifted filmmaker James Gunn. If we ever forget that the MCU was ever a thing (we won't but let's just be hypothetical), many generations will still be talking about this fantastic movie."
r96sk,"When planning how I was going watch all these MCU films, this is one I earmarked as being one I thought I'd enjoy - not based on anything of note, I knew very little, but from the passing screenshots and such I had seen it seemed like one I'd enjoy. I'm happy to say I certainly did!

<em>'Guardians of the Galaxy'</em> is so enjoyable. It's 121 minutes of pure entertainment. It does, at least to me, have a different feel to it when compared to the nine preceding MCU films. That's not a negative for either this or those earlier productions, it just felt different to me.

I particularly enjoyed the cast, which features - as is customary at this point - a load of well known names. Chris Pratt is, probably, the perfect choice for Peter, he carries the role extremely well - his humour sticks out, but he also performs the more serious stuff nicely.

Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper and Michael Rooker are all thoroughly enjoyable too. Vin Diesel (kinda?) appears to portray Groot, which pleases me as someone who is a big fan of <em>'Fast & Furious'</em>. There are a few others in there, including Djimon Hounsou and Benicio del Toro. Terrific cast!

There is a lot to like here. I look forward to seeing the follow-ups to it."
CinemaSerf,"Generally speaking, I'm fan of Chris Pratt and here he is thoroughly entertaining as the ""Star Lord - Peter Quill"", a sort of inter-galactic treasure hunter who is challenged to track down an orb. Once he finds and tries to sell it, his world becomes a whole lot more interesting as just about everyone from Djimon Hounsou - sporting a cracking hairdo as ""Korath"", to kick-ass Zoe Saldana ""Gamora"" and the most unlikely of duos ""Rocket"" & ""Groot""- one a racoon (Bradley Cooper), the other a walking tree with an extremely limited vocabulary (Vin Diesel) - want to snatch it from him! It soon transpires that the orb contains a source of unimaginable power that the evil ""Thanos"" and his lieutenant ""Ronan"" (Lee Pace) will stop at nothing to possess. When all these attempts to steal his artefact attract the attention of the authorities lead by an immaculately coiffured Glenn Close, they end up in a maximum security prison where they decide to join forces - alongside the deservedly named ""Drax the Destroyer"" (Dave Bautista), forcing their way out and setting off on a quest to stop the arch criminals from reducing Ms. Close's world to atoms. It's got bundles of charisma, this film - the script is witty and fast moving, the characters are easily the most interesting and developed in the ensemble Marvel-verse, and the pretty eclectic soundtrack is used properly, rather than as a substitute for the dialogue. I'm praying that it doesn't spawn a whole slew of pointless sequels and spin-offs; it's originality is an huge part of it's charm."
Reno,"Well, one off from two of this year's most expected movies alongside 'The Battle of Five Armies'. Like all the Chris Nolan fans, I was equally excited to see the movie on the opening day opening show. But I slightly disappointed that it was not a digital 3D film. I agree, this science-fiction was more dramatized than usual space travel stories does with an adventure-thriller. Almost a 3 hour long stretch movie did not waste much time to take us to the core of the story. Get prepared for this extremely rare voyage into the space with a logical explanation for everything you see on the screen. Well done research for the most matured and intelligent writing. All the credit must go to Nolan brothers. A good sign from Jonathan Nolan, who can make big in the entertainment industry in a future like his brother.

As we know many had liked 'Inception', to me that was a simple multi-layered action movie, that's all. But the same stuffs that used in this film makes sense. In fact, you have to have a little knowledge over how the universe works, so then it will be easy to catch the scene and situations while watching the movie. Totally like a documentary style concept, but with the additional stuffs like characters and its emotions add flavor that gives a movie look. An educational movie, though it also can work for those who wants just entertainment. Only the slow movie pace would test their patience.

It all begins like Shyamalan's 'Signs' movie with a family living surrounded by corn field. Then switches to 'The Astronaut Farmer' and going through 'Gravity', finally meets the 'Inception'. It was just a reference to call the movie setting that brings constant change for every half an hour. Like the opening scene and the end scene had over a 100 years difference.

As I earlier said it was the story of a family alongside the future of humankind and decoding universal mysteries through travelling in space and time. This movie would a reasonable for those who thought '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a boring piece, Cleverly written cinematic piece especially for science geeks. I don't know how perfect the movie to the actual present astrophysics, but will justify for the common people's capacity of understanding with an encourageable amount of commercial elements in it to entertain as well.

The first three quarters of the movie was well made. It puts me in a unblinkable position like a story was narrated by Brian Cox in a television series. Like I said, lots of astrophysics involved in it, but strangely human emotions were also exhibited equally that I never expected one from Nolan film. It was not an ordinary sentiment, but was strong enough to make a man cry for happy and sad situations in the movie. I liked science and emotion coming together. In fact, it saved the movie, otherwise it would have been a science documentary straight from NASA production through Nolan direction.

There are many surprise elements in the movie and of course there is a twist at the end. We can call it a series of twists like the layers. Compared to last quarter of the movie to the rest, it completely detaches which opens broadly to the different directions. And that happens so fast rushing towards the other end. Which give an impression of the movie 'Inception'. In a perfect way to say the first 75% was 'The Tree of Life' and the remains are 'Inception'.

‘‘This world's a treasure,
but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.’’

All the actors were so good. Matthew McConaughey steals the show as he dominates the majority of the screen space in the story presentation. There's no ruling out the fine performance executions from Anne Hathaway and the young star from the Twilight movie, Mackenzie Foy. The remaining cast was having less scope which were like the guest appearances that was widened a little broader, but was perfectly fitted for the story. Especially Matt Damon's was the crucial one.

Remember the movie 'Contact', a lovely movie, which was ruined by its fictional ending. Something like that happened in this film as well. The story was initiated with a realistic approach with actual scientific contents as per the present understanding about the universe. But the end was let me down with the layered contents that kind of impossible to agree with it. As a cinematic theme it worked, yeah, a good solution for this wonderfully written story. We know that the time can't run backwards, so that's the trouble.

Anyway, this movie defines in a new way, I mean scientifically the existence of ghost. It was not a horror movie, but I liked supernatural force that merged with this science fiction theme. That explains and gives vast ideas to expand our physics beyond something and somewhere yet to reach. Hats off to the director, because he was not thinking of making money here. His idea was to implement what the humans are understood so far about the cosmos. And he very nicely transformed those into the silver screen with the blend of human emotions. In my opinion, this will replace '2001: A Space Odyssey' for sometime till another one make this way.

I could have not asked a better space travel drama than this, especially when I heard Nolan doing a science-fiction I believed he gonna rock it. He was so true to the science and the human feelings in this film. If you had seen enough movies before like this one, you can recall your memories like the Tom Hanks parts from 'Cloud Atlas'. But still independently stands strong and falls in a never seen before category.

‘‘Maybe we've spent too long
trying to figure all this out with theory.’’

The end scene leaves a hint of a possible sequel. I would be happy if that happen in a near future, but definitely that would be a completely different cinema as per how this one ended. I know his fans want that to happen and so am I.

The visuals were not that great, but simply very good. To see those in digital 3D would have given us a different experience, sadly Nolan was not in favor of that technology. Hoping this movie would get as many as the Oscars nod. Especially not getting into the best motion picture shortlist would be a shame. Like I said I'm no one fan, I just love watching everyone's every movie. I would have went to see it again if it was converted into digital 3D, since I'm modern tech geek when it comes to the films.

It will become a talk of the week, perhaps month all over the world, so don't leave behind when your friends talk about it. What I gonna say is it is a must see asap if you are a movie fanatic like me otherwise Nolan movies does not need anyone's recommendation because his movies usually sell itself like the hot samosa."
decovision,"People seem to think that if you enjoy a Christopher Nolan movie, you are a fanboy and the film couldn't really be that good. That is not true. He has never made a bad movie, Insomnia is probably his worst and it is still an excellent movie. 
Interstellar is up there in his top 3, with The Dark Knight being number 1 and Inception in number 2. I don't think he will ever make a better movie than The Dark Knight, it is without a doubt a masterpiece of cinema in my opinion. It can be enjoyed on so many levels.
I remember seeing Interstellar in the movie theater and being on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was breathtaking but the end left me confused so i walked out disappointed. 
Since then i have watched it many times but it only took a second viewing to realize what a great ending it is and here is why. How many people discuss the end, was the wormhole open or closed for him to make it to Brand, what happens next, is there a sequel. I discuss this with people who hate the movie and the debate will still last a good 30 minutes if not more without getting heated. It is a wonderful story told through the eyes of a genius film maker who deserves more than he receives, an oscar would be nice start.
I read hat his next movie is to be released in July 2017, I can't wait to find out everything about it like i have since he began.
If you're unsure about Christopher Nolan, watch his career from the beginning starting with Doodlebug."
Andres Gomez,"Another grandiloquent movie from Christoper Nolan.

The cast is good, and McConaughey performs a role made for himself. The photography is very nice but the movie commits all the same mistakes than previous Nolan's movies. I think mistakes but it may be that they are the points Nolan fans enjoy the most ...

* The story makes you believe it is a realy deeply thought plot but, in the end, it has so basic mistakes and stupidities that make it nonsensical.
* There is a general ambience of every moment being epic; deep, solemn and smart dialogues but, at some point our highly trained engineer and pilot behaves really stupidly.
* To keep the mentioned constant feeling of being in an epic moment, Nolan uses a thumping and insistent soundtrack. As it is not a moment, but a 3h movie, it is really tiresome.

All in all, the movie is OK but you can only think this is a great movie if you are a real Nolan fan."
Asadullah Khan,"""Man kind was born on earth, it was never meant to die here.""

IT has been two days since I watched it and I still can't get it out of my head. I can safely say that it has been a long LONG time since a movie had this much effect on me after watching it. And the only thing I can think of now is to somehow Re-Watch it again.

This movie was surprisingly different from Christopher Nolan's recent works because they had been great cinematic entertainment pieces catered to a wider audience with a blockbuster approach, this certainly didn't felt like that and hence the polarizing response it got. It is an ambitious project that is not meant to merely entertain, walk into it knowing that. I'll say this though, If it works for you, you'll be in heaven.

The premise of the movie is that Earth is no longer capable of supporting humans on it, we must find a new home to avoid extinction. This scenario is told from a very personal perspective and not from a Global scale like some sort of apocalyptic catastrophe disaster film. At the core of the movie is the Father-Daughter relationship. The movie takes its sweet time to develop it too.

Mathew McConaughey, not surprisingly, gives an amazing performance as the main lead. He really carries the film, some scenes were very emotional due to his great performance. The rest of the cast does a great job as well, especially the Daughter played by Meckenzie Foy. The One character that I never expected to be great was the robot TARS. He also acted as the source of the humor in the movie, well executed, timely and grounded.

Interstellar tackles a lot of themes, Survival, Humankind, Love, Time etc, out of which 'Time' had the biggest impact on me. With relativity being a big part in the film, the whole sequence about it just struck me very deeply and I found new respect for Time. I'm actually at a loss of words to describe it. Also, there is a lot science in it so it can be confusing for many and in Nolan's tradition, it also has twists and mind numbing ending, where the more you think about it, the more numbing it gets.

The visuals of this movie are breathtaking. Great cinematography and CGI. The depiction of wormholes and blackholes and other space entities were the best I have ever seen. They just suck you into the movie. Along with that, you get to listen to one of Hans Zimmer's best scores. The score not only felt personal, going perfectly with the movie, but also different from his recent works. There were times where combination of epic photography and soundtrack made the scenes timeless, like I was completely sucked into it and didn't had a clue about my surroundings. I didn't want those scenes to end.

Alas, the movie was not perfect. My biggest gripe with it is that the pacing and editing was off at times. Some scenes dragged on while others were cut far shorter. The beautiful views of space could have definitely benefited from a few seconds longer onscreen time. Also, I wished there was more space exploration in it.

With all the remakes, rehashes, reboots and sequels we are getting in these times, it is great to see original gems like these. This movie is definitely one of this year's best, one of Nolan's best work and one of the best movie I have seen in recent years.

shaunfrombklyn,"This was my most anticipated film of 2014, and I was not disappointed. 

The story was slightly difficult to follow on the first watch, but that was to be expected in a film dealing with complicated fields such as astrophysics and time dilation. Many didn't find its overall message - that love is the most powerful force in the universe which transcends space and time - to be very appealing, but I thought it was an interesting take on special relativity and how two people can be bound by a common feeling, even when they're in different parts of the universe at different times. I also thought the acting was believable, for the most part, and I didn't think anyone was miscast. I enjoyed the surprise appearance from a certain famous actor about halfway through.

But what really blew me away were the visuals and the soundtrack. I believe it was Quentin Tarantino who once said movies and music go hand in hand; that a moving image complimented by the right piece of music can create art. Well, the visuals in this film, which took my breath away, and the score, which perfectly captured the 'feel' of the cosmos and all its wonder, proved him right. I think this was Hans Zimmer's best work yet, and although I'm not Christopher Nolan's biggest fan, I will continue to follow his work if he can pull off more movies like this. 

My only regret was not seeing this film in IMAX.

Per Gunnar Jonsson,"That this movie, at the time of writing this, holds an 8.8 rating at IMDb is simply beyond my understanding. Needless to say I did not really like this movie. The story is not very good, the science is ludicrous and the visuals not all that impressive. Maybe the latter would be better in a big theater (I watched this on my home cinema system which has a relatively large screen by European standards) but I am not really sure about that either.

Be warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two.

The movie starts of with the usual “I told you so” wet dream of the green fanatics on a dying Earth so it is off to a depressing start right away. That is an overused concept today as far as I am concerned. Then they pour it on with a school official claiming that he Apollo missions and moon landings never happened. What the f…? If they wanted to depress the audience right from the start they succeeded, at least with this audience.

The story proceeds with our heroes finding these gravity waves in the sand and by a huge stretch of imagination decrypts them to mean coordinates which leads them to the secret NASA base. Once there Cooper is told that he is their best choice of pilot for a “save the human race” mission through a wormhole. Yeah, right! This guy was former NASA. His whereabouts could hardly been unknown to them. If he was their best choice why would they entrust a mission to save the human race to someone else until he stumbled onto their door? Typical Hollywood nonsense!

The movie is full of this kind of rubbish. Romilly wastes 23 years of his life doing pretty much nothing except deciding not to go into the sleep capsule. The supposedly highly trained and vetted professor that they do find turns out to be a psychopath as well as and idiot almost blowing up the ship when trying to proceed with a docking that all the systems tells him have not succeeded. Then they proceed to dock with the main ship and stop its spin as well as bring it out of orbit around a planet with the shuttles engines. That is one hell of a powerful shuttle not to mention the strength of the docking mechanism! This just goes on. When someone is not doing something illogical or stupid (or both) they sit around talking, philosophizing and dragging the movie forward at snails pace. 169 minutes is way too much for this movie.

The movie ends up in one big time travel mess (okay they do not travel in time, just sends messages through time but still…) during a bunch of psychedelic scenes while traveling through the back hole. Science? Not so much. And what about this totally ludicrous massively illogical and inefficient robot design?

The one good thing I can say about this movie is that the performance of most of the actors, especially Matthew McConaughey, are quite good. For the rest, not my cup of tea."
akashmahajan,"Again hit produced by christopher nolan after batman.
Storyline is great and also the science theory is perfectly showcased."

Interstellar is my favorite movie. I'm really into space and everything about it, so this movie was my cup of tea. 
The soundtrack is the best of the movie. It points out flow of time, which is the most discussed issue in the movie. Special effects are breathtaking. Even with some small mistakes, it is pretty accurate and expectable. There is some visually pleasing cinematography too, including Saturn, the curvature of spacetime or majestic black hole, which is really satisfying. Some scenes are loud and thrilling, but some moments are so quiet, that you actually think, you are in space!
The movie is long but gripping. The plot, although it's complicated, is told easily and understandably. But the end of the movie is difficult to understand, since it contains time loop and time travel at the same time, but if you listen carefully, you will get it. I watched the movie 7 times and I still enjoy it!"
Matthew Brady,"""Do not go gentle into that good night; Old age should burn and rave at close of day. Rage, rage against the dying of the light"".

The story is about a team of explorers undertakes the most important mission in human history; traveling beyond this galaxy to discover whether mankind has a future among the stars.

Christopher Nolan once said that 2001: A Space Odyssey was his all time favorite film and how he wanted to do a small tribute to he's next film. And then comes a movie called ""Interstellar"" that will put a smile on Kubrick face if he was alive today, because Interstellar is one of the best movie of 2014 and the best movie experience I've had at the cinema.

I saw this movie in IMAX and all through out this film I felt like I was in space floating around with Mconaughey and Anne Hathaway. I had that feeling that I was going deep into space just like are main character's, going deep into space just like the viewing auditions and me.

The visual effect's in this movie are some of the most stunning, beautiful and Jaw dropping effect's I've seen since 2001: A Space Odyssey. The performances were brilliant, The cinematography was breathtaking and hard to look away. The directing by Christopher Nolan and let me get this out there, this man is a true director; he knows cinema and knows how to interested people into seeing he's films and I'm still shocked that he hasn't won an Oscar yet.

Now most people or critics have said that last third of this movie ruined the movie for them, but I actually like the ending to the movie. It's new for Nolan because he always ends on a deep and cold note, but this movie didn't and I didn't mind it.

My only nick pick with the movie is some of the character's in this movie wasn't all that interesting. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are the only character's that to me were interesting and I cared for them, but the rest of the character's I didn't really care for.

Overall Interstellar is a mind-blowing movie with fantastic visual's, interesting story line and the movie will keep you interested till the end."
Peter McGinn,"I will not add another in depth review to the several I see here on this movie. Nor will I try to evaluate the accuracy of the science behind the plot. Apparently a physicist was involved who had veto power if the script wandered out of the realm of what is at least theoretically true or possible.

But I have never let inaccuracies get in the way of enjoying science fiction movies anyway, as long as the movie is entertaining and otherwise doesn’t insult my intelligence. In the movie Monsters, for example, I read that giant the aliens looking like octopuses could not have walked upright. Fair enough, but it is entertainment, not a documentary.

So the human story of Interstellar held my attention in spite of the length of the film, and despite the elaborate special effects, that story drove the movie and my appreciation of it. I have always liked good time travel movies as well, and theories of space and time come into play in Interstellar as well.

Oh, and I say it is entertainment rather than a documentary, but it is not light entertainment. If you want to give this movie a fair chance, give it your full attention. It is not Mars Attacks, where you can watch it while distracted by life and still pick up on  plot details."
kheirnandez,"I've got to say I have been wanting to watch this film for a while now and well it's 2021 and it's a Saturday morning and damn, safe to say this is one of the best films I have ever watched in my life. loved everything about It. The creativity and intelligence put into this film is just mind-blowing considering the fact it is a 2014 film. This clearly shows that mankind will one day achieve the most unexpected and unthought discoveries.
Love and respect to the director Christopher Nolan you are a legend."
lowkimhoe,"It opens my mind after I watched this movie. I have watched it twice to figure out everything on the movie. Basically, this is the movie talking about earth is not a good place to stay anymore. People have to go to space to find another homeland. It reminds me that we will be like them if we didn't care much on environment"
CinemaSerf,"As humanity faces an existential crisis, farmer ""Cooper"" (Matthew McConaughey) and his family are fighting a losing battle against an environment determined to destroy what is left of their corn crop. Mystery arrives after a sand storm leaves some magnetic clues to a secret location inhabited by NASA scientists led by ""Brand"" (Sir Michael Caine) who manage to convince former pilot ""Coop"" to join a mission to go into space and, using a recently detected wormhole that he believes may have been deliberately sent to help mankind rescue itself, set off to find another home for us all. Leaving a seriously narked daughter behind, he accepts the mission and together with the daughter of ""Brand"" (Anne Hathaway) their perilous trek begins. This is a more solid sci-fi adventure from Christopher Nolan. Though it features doses of his usual time bending scenarios, for the most part it is an exciting action film with mishaps a-plenty as their mission sees danger at just about every junction. There is a decent chemistry between Hathaway and McConaughey allowing the characters to develop with some depth that helps to draw us into to their efforts. The visual effects are superb, it has TARS - a rather clunkily designed robot that proves a whizz when running and rescuing, and the ending has something of the Escher drawing to it. The narrative can be thought provoking offering quite an interesting series of choices, especially when Matt Damon (""Mann"") joins the story and begins to challenge their approach to just what ""humanity"" might actually be! A host of celebrated co-stars prop it up well. John Lithgow is effective as the patriarch of the family and Casey Affleck and Wes Bentley help diffuse the intensity of the principal relationship as the space-bound menace gradually accumulates. It's all but three hours long, and there is no denying that it hits a barren spell at times during the middle hour, but for my money this is a Nolan film that does not over-complicate itself and is as good a science fiction thriller as I've seen in many a year."
ohlalipop,"When I first saw the trailer for this film, I knew that this would attract a lot of attention. Of course having Leonardo in the lead role helped a lot. 


From the trailer, I already know some things. Dreams. All about dreams. But what about dreams? Who are the other people? At first, I didn't really understand what was going on. It was all very confusing to me. But as the movie progresses, I start to understand it and I wanted to watch some more and know more what will happen in the end. The ending. That was, I think, the most intense ending of a movie in a year or probably more than a year. People actually screamed when the screen faded. And of course, people couldn't help but talk about it. It was an open-ended movie where people will have their own endings. My favorite part was Joseph Gordon's fight scene. I think he has the most fun part in this movie.


My rate for this movie is A."
tmdb44006625,"Whether you watch Inception as a heist movie, a redemption story, or a sci-fi action picture, Christopher Nolan's tour de force of dreams will absolutely work its magic over you. The fact that the film works on so many levels (literally) is an attest not only to the visual queues that make it easy for the audience to follow but to how much in control of all the intricacies its filmmaker had to be."
Varya,"Is there anyone on earth who doesn't like Christopher Nolan’s films? Inception is one of his masterpieces. It’s a science fiction film released in 2010 and written by undoubtedly one of the greatest directors in Hollywood, Christopher Nolan, the creator of such stunning films as ‘Memento’, ‘The dark knight’, Prestige’ and ‘Interstellar’. the cast is impressive: the main roles are played by Leo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine.

The film is based on the idea of lucid dreams. In the story, the professionals of industrial espionage, using special techniques to steal valuable secrets from the depths of the subconscious during sleep, when the human mind is most vulnerable, learn a new technique - the ‘inception’ of ideas into the human mind through his dream. The main character - Dom Cobb is a talented thief, his rare abilities made him a truly valuable player in the treacherous world of espionage, but they also turned him into a perennial fugitive and stripped him of everything he had ever loved. One day Cobb has a chance to correct mistakes. His latest case can bring everything back, but for that he needs to do the impossible - inception.

There are so many good things about the film. The plot of the film is definitely mind-blowing. You won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. The soundtrack is written by Hans Zimmer, who is certainly one of the most sought-after composers. I think all his music is incredibly touching, dramatic and powerful. There are also some iconic songs we all know. The work on the special effects is done flawlessly, evidently, a lot of money was spent on this. The acting is also wonderful, Leo DiCaprio, who was the first actor to accept the offer to play in the film, has done an amazing job.

The only thing that viewers can find bad about this film is that it can be extremely difficult to perceive. If you don’t watch the film close enough you can simply get lost in all these jumping from dreams to reality.

A curious fact is that Christopher Nolan released the film in 2010 but started working on it at the beginning of the 2000s! I would recommend everyone to see the film, even if you are not interested in sci-fi."
Matthew Brady,"Ariadne: ""Why is it so important to dream?""

Cobb: ""Because, in my dreams we are together.""

I haven't seen this movie in years, but after re-watching it struck me hard how depressing this was.

Putting aside the action sequences and loud music and a complicate plot, there's a beautiful story about a man trying to get back to his children, without it being cheesy. Well if you really break this movie at it's core, it's about two grieving men (Leo and Murphy), both haunted by the past until they have the strength to accept reality and let them go.

The 'Grow Old Together' scene stuck with me the most.

You can say whatever you want about Christopher Nolan, but his movies are never hollow. I'm also convince that Nolan would be the perfect choice to direct a James Bond movie.

Seriously, throughout the whole movie I was thinking ""Man imagine the genius behind Inception directing a Bond movie"". The ingredients are right there."
Adam Rife,"This is actually a Perfect movie. It is the 2nd perfect movie I've seen and it is flawless in almost every way. Since perfection itself is an imaginary value like Infinity or <a href=""https://paperhelp.nyc/"">paperhelp</a> that when you add +1 to it, or make it better in any way, that adds to the imaginary state of infinity itself making it factually an imaginary number. There are only a few issues, such as a little too fast pacing, even though the film itself is about 2:17:00 long, and also I would have preferred them not show the helper on the train until After it was revealed to be a 2nd dream state. Also some bland emotional displays overall. Other than these small issues it is as perfect as a movie can be made. Totally Amazing film when you are in the mood for an action movie. WATCH TWICE, or more, as it would be nearly impossible to truly experience this film without seeing it 2 times in short breaks between viewings."
Frank Ochieng,"One might nostalgically recall the days back when the cheesy yet infectious Japanese monster movies were such a magnificent draw during those hazy Saturday afternoons showcasing the double creature feature matinees that aired weekly on television. We were considered very lucky if we had Mothera battle Gamera in one showing followed up by experiencing the sheer thrill of watching Rodan take on his latest ferocious foe as well. However, as well-known as these mentioned Far East big screen beasts were in all their glorious rage and colorful destruction nobody was as legendary or instrumental in seriously wreaking havoc on vulnerable Japanese soil both heroically or horrendously than our heralded King of Carnage in the celebrated _Godzilla_. 

The famed and humongous rumble-and-tumble reptile makes a grand return courtesy of Toho Studios reviving the catastrophic critter in writer/co-director Hideaki Anno’s and Shinji Higuchi’s monster mash offering **Godzilla Resurgence** (a.k.a.”Shin Godzilla”). Interestingly, the last _Godzilla_ flick that was released by Toho Studios was more than a decade ago in 2004. Naturally, Japanese audiences were privileged to the exploitative antics of the favorable large lizard when **Godzilla Resurgence** premiered earlier this year.

Thankfully, Anno’s and Higuchi’s spry creature concoction is now showing up in limited release in other countries as _Godzilla_ dusts off his combative cobwebs from yesteryear and makes a contemporary return to the cinematic psyches for baby-boomers looking to revive their childhood memories of the spike-toothed rampaging rogue doing what he does best: stomping through the endangered streets of Japan in the name of high-wire popcorn entertainment. In any event, there is a willing welcome wagon to embrace this familiar and feisty monstrous menace with robust enjoyment. There have been previous _Godzilla_ editions that were not necessarily received with the pat-on-the-back reception (yes Roland Emmerich–we are referencing your disastrous take on 1998’s _Godzilla_). Still, **Godzilla Resurgence** accomplishes the impossible as it stays close to its humble 1954 roots while managing to sprinkle some fresh impishness within its clever manufactured mayhem.

The screening experience of viewing the majestic monster _Godzilla_ is stunning and surreal because the film’s handlers create the terrorizing tension and torture of a full-scale predator crashing his way into the miniature-sized obstacles (people, buildings, bridges, power lines, etc.) with demolished durability. The physical details on the _Godzilla_ monster are hideously wondrous and every bloody drool from the creature’s jagged mouth and ominous scaly skin is profoundly sinister. The thought of Godzilla’s two-ton tail pouncing and waving with destructive defiance generates the additional mystique of this Asia-based destroyer.

For those not quite informed about the backstory of the _Godzilla_ mythology it is quite simple: a classical creature was born/created back in 1954 at Toho Studios where filmmaker Ishiro Honda presented a monster flick that would go on to endure as a cult favorite in Japanese cinema and elsewhere around the world for the next six decades. Sure, the various _Godzilla_ installments (not including the derivative American versions) were saddled in inspired cheesiness (you got to love the laughable “man-in-the-monster-suit” cheapened special effects) with toy model sets serving as a deteriorating Japanese background to _Godzilla’s_ cinematic wrath. Nevertheless, the clear message was received thoughtfully and philosophically–_Godzilla_ and his creepy contemporaries was conceived and symbolic of that country’s disillusionment with its atomic bombing past. As a result, the Japanese-based beasts were reflective of the man-made devastation that haunted a targeted region of the world that knew annihilation and humiliation. _Godzilla_ made for some escapist thrills and chills for Japanese movie audiences in the heyday of the 50’s and 60’s but Honda’s alarming predatory pest would also resonate as a freakish catalyst for the country’s past and present turmoil for political, societal and technological survival. Hence, _Godzilla_ is a representative (and product) of a historical nuclear blast that remains as an immense ugly chapter in humanity.

**Godzilla Resurgence** (_Shin Godzilla_) introduces good ole Godzilla as a mystery wrecking machine unbeknownst to the Tokyo city officials that have no clue in how to contain the unknown boisterous, beastly intruder as he storms through Japan like a loose sledgehammer through a light bulb factory. Once the return of the ravenous Godzilla had been identified the big brass now has to figure out how to eradicate the enormous fiendish phenomenon. Do they nuke the corrosive creature without the dire consequences of sacrificing its jeopardized citizens in the territory?

As the Japanese government agonizes over what should be done with Godzilla’s dubious presence as he methodically smashes everything in his wicked path the cynicism grows moment by moment. Specifically, why is Godzilla’s tumultuous existence impacting their way of life? Is the creature’s overstayed welcome some sort of plot from the rest of the world to dump unrest and debauchery on their sacred grounds? Better yet can the foreign superpowers such as the United States, China or Russia collaborate to help terminate the mighty monster? Will Godzilla disturb global concerns and if so how will the militaristic mindset play out in Japan’s beleaguered backyard?

**Godzilla Resurgence** aims to be more than just a typical giant monster movie mired in splashy CGI special effects and engulfed explosions. Anno (“Evangelion”) and Higuchi (“Attack on Titan”) actually serve up a sophisticated and thought-provoking creature caper that digs underneath the throwaway exploitation surface. The tongue-in-cheek nostalgia is firmly maintained and the moviegoers are treated to their share of Godzilla’s manic mischievousness. Importantly, Anno and Higuchi amp up their brand of a disguised political potboiler in the form of a sci-fi monster B movie that sufficiently labors at mirroring the current-day chaos and conflicts that bombard a modern-day Japan (or any inserted nation for that matter). Whether spotlighting international trust/distrust or pinpointing kaiju (meaning “big, brutal monsters”) terrorism as an allegory for Japan’s temporary unseen but inevitable national fallout caused by an impenetrable nature disaster it is quite revealing that **Godzilla Resurgence** delves beyond its cartoonish ruination.

Whatever interpretation that one derives from **Godzilla Resurgence** the verdict is undeniably sound that Toho Studios delivers a lively and message-driven platform about uncontrollable forces and critical decisions that befall an ambivalent country undergoing in-house scrutiny. To put it in layman’s terms: **Godzilla Resurgence** is a surprisingly well-done despite its sometimes campy makeup. Surely **Resurgence** is solid enough to uphold the G-man’s beloved legacy in the kaiju genre.

Andres Gomez,"Peter Jackson creates the same world that he already shown us in the LOTR, but that's not the only thing he repeats.

He also repeats ripping Tolkiens book into a sucession of endless races and actions scenes with orcs falling everywhere and several ""inventions"" that mess the beautiful story created by the English author.

He also repeats those several minutes of platform game inside caves that we saw in Moria and in his version of King Kong.

If you loved the previous movies from Jackson, you will love this too.

If you are looking for some quality, you will only finding in the re-creation of the Middle Earth and the peformances of Ian McKellen, Martin Freeman and Cate Blanchett."
GeekMasher,"An other great master peace has been added the the Lord of The Rings collection. This movie was an excellent example of how great actors, an amazing story and a beautiful world can be produced in such an excellent way. Peter Jackson has out done his self by creating this great film. There are differences from the book but I can't complain about any of them, yes I love the original story but this one is still one of the best. All in all a amazing movie."
Matt Golden,"Over a decade after a little-known director from New Zealand managed to con New Line Cinema into giving him $300 million to make a trilogy based on JRR Tolkien's seminal fantasy (and long considered unfilmable) work The Lord of the Rings, the cinematic landscape for fantasy has changed drastically. Much like Tolkien's tome, the Lord of the Rings films came to utterly define high fantasy in film, with even competing fantasy adaptations like The Chronicles of Narnia and Alice in Wonderland cribbing from Peter Jackon's critically-acclaimed, audience-adored multipart epic. Now Jackson has returned to the land that made him famous for a go-round with Tolkien's earlier work, The Hobbit.

Tolkien's The Hobbit is far more modest in scope than its enormous sequel, and geared for a younger audience. It introduced the world to Bilbo Baggins, a typically quiet hobbit who is coaxed into adventure by the grey wizard Gandalf, enlisted to aid thirteen dwarves in reclaiming their long-lost homeland.

Jackson had the unenviable task of following up on his blockbuster Academy Award-winning masterpiece, and initially passed off the directing responsibilities to fantasy master Guillermo del Toro. Difficulties securing the film rights led to delay after delay, and del Toro finally departed, leaving the original creative team the ability to step back into place and create a follow-up/lead-in with the same creative staff in front of and behind the camera. Jackson returned as director, co-writing with Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens (though del Toro retains a screenwriting credit), Andrew Lesnie as cinematographer, and Howard Shore as composer, along with all of the other stalwarts of the original trilogy.

The lone exception to that is the recasting of Martin Freeman as the titular hobbit, taking over for the aging Ian Holm. Holm appears in the film's framing sequence (a scene that takes place immediately prior to the beginning of The Fellowship of the Ring), along with that trilogy's star, Elijah Wood. But this time out, it's Freeman's show, and he's as charming, witty, and engaging as you could imagine. He also makes a perfect Young Ian Holm. The casting is truly inspired. Sir Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf (here playing his more impish grey incarnation, rather than the frankly humorless white version) and the heralded thespian manages to imbue his character with both immense power and gravitas, while still throwing in little flourishes that sell Gandalf as an imperfect man, rather than just an all-knowing power. Rounding out the third of this film's main characters, and an addition to this world, is Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, the leader of the motley crew of dwarves. Armitage likewise manages to imbue Thorin with both rage and honor, and is easily believable as someone who could lead these dwarves into life-threatening battle. The other twelve dwarves are something of a blur, but a few of them manage to make an impression, even with limited screen time. I imagine the two future installments of the series will afford them each the chance to shine.

Which brings up the most contentious point of this whole Hobbit affair: the fact that it's a three-part epic. The Hobbit, as written, is a comparatively slim tome of around 300 pages (compare that to The Lord of the Rings' combined 1,600). This installment alone is ten minutes shy of a whopping three hours. And as anyone who's seen The Return of the King can attest, Jackson can get rather indulgent at times (the end[s] of that film). Initially the film was going to be split in twain, then later divvied up into three parts. Tolkien, ever the completist, wrote volumes of backstories for this world, and Jackson decided to pull from them to bulk out these films.

I've seen a lot of hay being made about the film being bloated and, yes, indulgent. I'm an editor at heart, and am generally hyper-sensitive about cutting down to the bone. But the strangest thing happened on the way to the Lonely Mountain: I found myself simply rolling along with the shaggy-dog pace of the film. It's astonishing in hindsight. The film virtually redefines ""taking the scenic route,"" but the crazy thing is I didn't mind it in the least. I believe it's because of the lowered stakes of The Hobbit. Every single frame of The Lord of the Rings was suffused with overbearing doom; that trilogy's ""save the world"" plot became as heavy a burden to bear as the ring hung around Frodo's neck. But The Hobbit is lighter, freer, funnier, and doesn't have the weight of the world on its shoulders. It's rather the difference between having an appointment you need to get to in heavy traffic and taking a weekend to just drive around, stopping when and where you like. This pace will likely have a dire impact on the film's rewatchability, but sitting in the theater for a midnight showing? Magic.

The structure of the film itself seems to have ADD. Its innumerable diversions began to remind me of a live-action Family Guy episode, with character or event mentions that suddenly cause the film to cut away to a dramatization of said. But again, and I can't stress enough how unexpected this was for me, I didn't mind in the least (with one exception: it appears to be an inviolable rule that any scene in Rivendell will stop a film dead in its tracks).

The craft of the film manages to best that of its predecessor trilogy: Howard Shore turns in one of his most stirring scores, the production design and art direction are again immersive and beautiful, and Andrew Lesnie continues his unique style of cinematography combining gorgeous shots (wonderful) with frequently blowing out highlights (distracting and ugly).

One complaint I do have is Jackon's newfound over-reliance on CGI. Azog the Defiler (a chief antagonist of the film) and the Goblin King (a bit of a lark) are the sorts of character that would have (and should have) been practical effects in the original trilogy. Here they're fully CGI, and their menace is undermined by it. Gollum returns for his most famous scene, and looks wonderful; Andy Serkis' performance and the CGI truly sell this pitiful creature. CGI can be pitiful but not threatening, it appears.

I don't know what the other two installments of The Hobbit have in store. What I do know is that this return to Middle-earth is off to a great start, and if this is any indication of things to come, I'll most assuredly enjoy the ride."
r96sk,"Of course off the level of its <em>'The Lord of the Rings'</em> predecessors, but I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed <em>'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey'</em>.

It has good lure to it, the plot is more than interesting, it features pleasant callbacks and - like LOTR - looks exquisite. As for the casting, I like 'em. Martin Freeman (Bilbo) is, like Elijah Wood, an actor I've always found hit-and-miss, but I really did enjoy Freeman's performance here - the humour is his usual schtick, though the rest of his showing is strong.

Ian McKellen (Gandalf) returns and is as much a joy to watch as before. None of the others, though all good, stand out massively, James Nesbitt (Bofur) does bring decent comedic stuff.

Hopefully the two sequels to this are just as fantastic!"
Peter McGinn,"There is no doubt that Peter Jackson does a great job bring Tolkien’s fantasies to life, much better, I imagine, than anyone must have assumed when they heard about the Lord of the Rings series way back when.

I must confess that I don’t like them as much as I enjoyed reading the books. I am sure there are complex reasons applicable to me. I read them when I was very young and it would be difficult to match that first-time experience. Also, the fighting and battles seem more central to the story than I remember. Perhaps that relates more to the modern movie audience rather than my memory.

As a funny side note, the film seemed to resemble in places that other fantasy series: the Jurassic Park franchise, in that they seemed to always be going from one close call to another, and the Wizard or somebody repeatedly yelled, “Run!” This series certainly sends the message that if you ever go on a dangerous adventure, it helps to have a wizard along for the journey."
Wuchak,"***Kinetic, “hip” street-racing flick with Vin Diesel and Paul Walker***

A newbie to Los Angeles (Paul Walker) falls for a café host (Jordana Brewster) while trying to join a street-racing gang led by her brother, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel). Meanwhile the LAPD are trying to apprehend a radical group on the highways that targets semis and their valuable cargo. Michelle Rodriguez is on hand as Dom’s babe while Matt Schulze plays an angry member of his gang.

“The Fast and the Furious” (2001) was the beginning of the popular street-racing franchise that currently has eight movies with two more planned. The over-the-top action is akin to “The Road Warrior” (1981) while the tone mixes the comic book melodrama of “The Warriors” (1979) and “Torque” (2004) with the more serious air of “Grand Canyon” (1991) and “Training Day” (2001). (Yes, I realize “Torque” and “Training Day” debuted after this one; I’m just providing comparative references). 

Speaking of the tone, there’s no goofiness and the actors take everything dead seriously, which is good in my book, but the flick has several unintentional laughs because, while quasi-realistic, the thrills & posing are so exaggerated.

Brewster and Rodriguez are effective in the feminine department, but neither do much for me personally. There are a few good-looking ladies in the periphery, however.

The soundtrack contains several dynamic urban numbers, including the excellent “Deep Enough” by Live.

The movie runs 1 hour, 46 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles & nearby areas (San Bernardino, Hemet, Malibu, Westminster, Beverly Hills, etc.).

GRADE: B"
Leslie Kell,"I can’t call this film a legend. The film, which gave a big push in such a concept as street racing and tuning cars. He raised interest in illegal races on the night streets, gave life to such a renowned game like Need for Speed: Underground, which in turn gained countless fans. And maybe the storyline is really simple and without frills, but its implementation is worthy of deep respect."
mooney240,"Point Break with cars! Sure it is a little cheesy but in the best way. Fun cast and fun premise. Diesel, Walker, Rodriguez, and Brewster deliver a great movie.

**Once again, Point Break with cars. Do you need more?**"
talisencrw,"One of Fincher's masterworks--though I like others better. He's definitely one of the only people alive who could have succeeded with this very intriguing story.

There are moments--when Benjamin's coming into his own, both with Tilda Swinton's character and with Cate Blanchett's--that are amongst the finest and most invigorating I have ever seen in cinema. I'm curious how I'll find it when I rewatch it in a few years. I have the impression that as I come to terms with age and gather more wisdom in my own skin, this story will only grow in my heart and appreciation--for both the highs and the lows. That is a spectacular magic trick for a movie to do--and Fincher's downright full of them."
Unknownian,"This movie is in my top 10 movie list in life. It is a cinema achievement that may never be outdone by 'anyone'. Considering that this masterpiece was shot digitally in 2007, it is miles above any CG effort since.

For those of you that haven't seen it: ""SEE IT"". Besides a great story (with one flaw), this film makes illusion and simulation become reality. 

The one flaw: I have great respect for David Fincher, and I am going to go out on a limb and say that he must have been aware of this discrepancy, but went ahead with the story-line as written anyway. ( I hope that's the case).
Benjamin Button was born ""old"", and regressed backwards to die an infant. The flaw in the story-line (and it's a big one), is that as he regresses to youth, he begins to have dementia (Alzheimer's symptoms), along with all of the arthritic pains and problems an old man gets as he ages. At the end, before he dies he loses his memory completely.

Logically, since he was born an old man, those illnesses should have evolved from birth, and improved as he regressed in age. Strangely in the film, he is born with severe arthritis, and can't even walk until he is 7. Why then would he again experience these same symptoms as a child on the way to his death bed (or crib)? He should be in perfect health as a child, and regress to a ""fetus"", and then disappear.  

Other than that major flaw, this movie is a 10. Unfortunately because of the illogical way he dies, I had to give it a 9 out of 10 stars.

One other issue with the plot: If we were to take this movie scenario and try to place it in the real world, Benjamin would have to have been born a ""full sized"", old man, and then after 70 or 80 years, he would have begun to shrink. Since the idea of a woman giving birth to a full sized man is physically impossible, our Benjamin had to be born old and ""tiny"". This of course is another contradiction in the plot, since Benjamin is small ""twice in his life"". We can't dwell on this flaw at all, because if we did we would never get passed it. To enjoy this movie, we must put all the facts and logistics of this scenario aside, and when we do, this movie takes us on a journey unlike any other ever filmed.   

"
GeekMasher,"A very good movie!
I'm not a massive comic book reader/fan and when I watched the first couple of the X-men movies I always wondered how it all begin and this movie do it justice! The actors where great (there no Patrick Stewart or Ian McKellen), Kevin Bacon played the baddie very well and was well suited for it and it was graphically impressive.
Loved to see the development of the characters over the duration of the film.
In all, I think it was a excellent movie."
Travis Bell,"I didn't love this movie. There were aspects about it from the perspective of an origin story that were interesting but something about the pacing and acting just felt… off. I can't quite put my finger on it but the first word that comes to mind is ""campy"". Kind of like I was watching one of the last three Star Wars movies. The dialog and overall tone just weren't serious enough.

The trailer for [X-Men: Days of Future Past](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/127585-x-men-days-of-future-past) looks better and Bryan Singer is back at the helm. The best X-Men movies are without a doubt 1 & 2 so here's hoping he can steer this back a bit."
DoryDarko,"On IMDb, X-Men: First Class has garnered the highest rating of all films in the X-Men franchise so far. Given the fact that this film features only a few of the familiar characters of the previous films, portrayed by different, younger actors, and the complete absence of Wolverine, the (current) rating of 8.1 somewhat surprised me. That was before I had seen it...

Being a pretty big X-Men fan myself, I was excited to see this, regardless of plot or characters. However, I was also a little wary of what to expect, for the reasons stated above. I suspect that anybody reading this might feel the same way. But rest assured, any doubts were quickly dispelled no later than the opening scene. First Class starts off very well, with the exact same opening scene as the first X-Men, featuring a young Erik Lehnsherr being separated from his parents in a Nazi concentration camp. What follows after this familiar story is something completely new and particularly dark and brutal. I won't give away any important plot lines, but suffice it to say there won't be a single person left wondering why Magneto is so resentful of ""normal"" people. This event also sets the tone for the rest of the film, and, to a great extent, explains why First Class is such a success: this film is all about character. Whereas all the other films were mostly about cool superheroes and special effects, First Class is all about character development and the history of those who would later become Professor X and Magneto. This concept might have failed big time if it wasn't for the superb screenplay. I take my hat off to whoever managed to incorporate every little, but crucial, character and storyline and made it flow together so beautifully. Literally everything comes together in this film, everything you might have wondered (why is Xavier paralyzed?) is given a credible and fitting explanation. 

Another real strength of FC is its cast. Everybody in this film is right where they should be. Kevin Bacon is the perfect villain (but we already knew that…), James McAvoy not only looks, but sounds and moves like the young Charles Xavier would. Jennifer Lawrence is a convincing, young (and believe it or not, insecure) Mystique. All other characters are perfectly cast as well, humans and mutants alike. However, I feel that most credit is due to Michael Fassbender, an actor I am now ashamed to say I had never even heard of before. The way he portrays the 30-something Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto is stunning. His entire physique, down to every little twitch in his face, truly captivates all the pain and agony Erik has had to endure throughout his life. It makes you sympathize with Magneto and understand why he is the way he is. Whereas the ""old"" Magneto was little more than a bitter old man who despised Homo sapiens for undisclosed reasons (with no discredit to Ian McKellen intended here), Michael Fassbender does something I thought was almost impossible in a superhero flick: he gives Magneto a soul.

In case I might have given the impression that X-Men: First Class is no more than some wishy-washy character drama, don't worry. There are plenty of awesome action sequences and special effects to keep the more adrenaline-pumped movie-goer satisfied. And before I forget: there are two small, but awesome cameo appearances which I know you will enjoy… 

Finally, a small note on parental guidance: I was absolutely baffled to see that half of the audience consisted of parents with small children. Like I said before, this is not just another cool superhero movie. X-Men: First Class features elements which are quite dark and graphic, and especially the scenes portraying Nazi brutality are not intended for a young audience. Personally, I would say 14 is the appropriate minimum age. 

With all that said, I would recommend this film to anyone, even to those of you who aren't X-Men fans. It doesn't happen very often that I can't find a single flaw in a film, but I guess this is just one of those rare cases. Great directing, great acting, great everything. Period.

r96sk,"My favourite so far.

<em>'X-Men: First Class'</em> is great fun. I felt entertained throughout with nothing bothering me whatsoever, with the score and the cast particularly standing out. I will say it starts stronger than it ends, but that's not to say it isn't all enjoyable because it certainly is.

James McAvoy is very good as Charles Xavier, while Michael Fassbender is excellent as Erik Lehnsherr. Rose Byrne, Jennifer Lawrence and Kevin Bacon were three others who I liked watching too. Back to the score, it's tremendous - some parts reminded me of the outstanding theme of television's <em>'The Crown'</em>.

I was feeling the decline across the preceding four releases, but thankfully this regains the series' footing and then some. Intrigued to see where it goes from here. Onwards to <em>'The Wolverine'</em>*! *watching in release order

/copied directly from my Letterboxd review\"
CinemaSerf,"If it's not sacrilegious for a Brit, I found this outing for the ""X-Men"" to be far better without the presence of the two elderly thespians who usually underpin these adventures. James McCoy takes on the mantle of the younger ""Xavier"" with Michael Fassbender introducing us to the role of ""Erik"". The former has the ability to read minds, his friend to manipulate metal. By means of flashbacks, we learn the back story for both of these characters, illustrating how they met and started to work together to ensure that their kind were safe and sound in an increasingly hostile world of human paranoia and suspicion. They are making progress until the re-emergence of ""Shaw"" (Kevin Bacon). Now he and ""Erik"" have a past - and the latter blames the other for leading atrocities carried out by the Nazis on his Polish family during WWII. His determination to seek revenge causes a rift between the two friends, and soon they - and their respective followers - are at loggerheads whilst a dangerous nuclear war looms for an humanity caught up in a devious cross-fire. Bacon isn't at his best here, he isn't remotely menacing - but the others, including Jennifer Lawrence's ""Raven"" and Nicholas Hoult's geeky ""Hank"" work well to give us quite an action-packed flavour of the birth of ""Magneto"" and of the foundations of his later hostilities with the ""X-Men"". The visual effects deliver well and the underlying narrative actually offers us a bit to think about - forgiveness, vengeance, fear and intolerance are all touched upon with a superior script that doesn't entirely rely on the effects and pyrotechnics to make it's point. This film works better on a big screen, these stories never really thrive on the television, and is easily - for my money - the best of the franchise I've yet seen."
Frank Ochieng,"The Hunger Games creator and mastermind Suzanne Collins has brought to life the explosive and resilient heroine Katniss Everdeen (not to mention the resourceful actress stepping into her action-oriented shoes and consciousness in the form of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence). Now with the conclusive The Hunger Games: Mockingjay--Part 2 ardent and casual fans of this imaginative and charged film franchise will get a chance to soak in the cinematic experience that has carried them through this durable trilogy. However, the question remains: does Mockingjay--Part 2 fulfill the adventurous swagger of its previous predecessors as it demonstrates its furious farewell in moodiness and mischievousness? Well, the answer is a resounding YES but some will still address the concept of the film's emotional and psychological leanings as merely serviceable to a string of feisty films that invited such passion, pronouncement and promise in its commentary on class struggle and societal survival means as a whole. 

The Hunger Games cinematic installments (and of course Collins's riveting literary outlets) have always been a solid and secure movie-going moment because it offered what so few action-packed features entailed: a perceptive and honest if not hedonistic look at the politics in the human psyche set aside from the rough-and-tumble sequences of action and suspense. The Games that were played in the minds of the audience were intriguing, thoughtful, compelling and smart about its wits and wisdom. All The Hunger Games editions were message-driven and presented a special kind of indescribable opulence and openness that was refreshing. Sure, there are the highs and lows that comes with the territory when mapping out a showcase of sequels bound to stumble on its lapses in story and characterization. Still, for the most part The Hunger Games: Mockingjay--Part 2 leaves the viewers wanting more but being compliant with what amounts to be the swan song for courageous cutie Katniss Everdeen's big screen legacy. 

It is quite clear that The Hunger Games: Mockingjay--Part 2 and its previous outings has carved a decisive niche into the Young Adult film fiction genre as one of the most successful and consistently received chapters that sparkled in its over-glow of gallant gumption and soul-searching turmoil. Indeed, Mockingjay--Part 2 does add its measurement of tension, radiance,  redemption and resolution. Importantly, Mockingjay--Part 2 maintains its reflective and steady balance of hope and rebellious vibes and Lawrence has not lost a single ounce of momentum in the few years since she donned the respectable defiance of the roguish Katniss out to settle a continuous score with the controlling powers-that-be.  Instinctively, labeling The Hunger Games motivating movie series as a pop cultural phenom would not risk the intention of sounding overdramatic because for the most part this film franchise has been a saving grace to the aforementioned Young Adult film fiction craze that has offered cemented substance in comparison to the soapy sentiments of the immense Twilight umbrella that spread like wildfire in the unguarded woods years before.

As one can imagine Mockingjay--Part 2 picks up where the first Mockingjay left off in its initial premise. Director Francis Lawrence (back at the helm) starts his narrative rather slow and plodding but builds up the sassy momentum as his on-screen victorious vixen Katniss Everdeen pounces on her latest exploits to expose and agitate the corruptible Capitol and its lead manipulator in the likes of the diabolical President Snow (Donald Sutherland). The good news is that the determined Katniss is finally reunited with her former Games companion and romantic partner Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). The bad news is that poor Peeta has been manipulated and convinced to view Katniss as an enemy courtesy of Snow's menacing minions. Automatically, this is the difficult wedge that puts a damper on Katniss's ability to go after Snow and his vile followers with Peeta serving as their brainwashed Boy Wonder with the forced hatred in tact. 

So now the course is set for Katniss Everdeen to follow as she decides to pursue her intentions of gradually taking down the governmental negligence of Snow and his abominable administration. Naturally, Katniss needs the assistance of the rebels under the tutelage of District 13's President Alma Coin (Oscar-winner Julianne Moore) as well as the input from wily gamemaster Plutarch Heavensbee (late Oscar-winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman) to take down the dangerous and devious Snow and his governmental criminal cronies. Politically, the opportunistic Coin wants Katniss in her camp for the mere promotion of propaganda...something that just does not sit well with the feminine avenger.

The stakes are understandably high but Katniss is in company with the likes of her childhood sweetie pie Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and old-time buddy Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) as they join forces to combat the evil clutched of the Capitol. The bottom line: the venomous President Snow needs to be cut down in his treacherous tracks...plain and simple. 

Quite frankly, the beleaguered Katniss is caught up in the complicated web of a couple of political powerhouses in the insufferable Snow (that wants to destroy her) and Coin (that wants to use her reputation for marketing purposes) willing to go at it while using Katniss's exposed neck as the sacrificial pawn to determine their sense of twisted greatness. For the most part, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay--Part 2 does present a skillful display of confusion and identity and Lawrence's death-dodging diva Katniss Everdeen is the epitome of a Girl on Fire with flames of indecision and doubt burning all around her. Who can she trust? Who has the fortitude to stick with the plan and ensure that the tedious target of Snow is silenced for sure? Can Katniss overcome the obstacles of her great love Peeta's perverse distaste for her while battling one narcissistic leader as another one she is joined at the hip exploits her presence? There seems to be a constant continuity for conflict in warfare and wounded souls that elevates Mockingjay--Part 2 as a boisterous board game of physical and psychological movement. As usual, Lawrence's Katniss carries the animated strife on her dainty yet athletic shoulders with bouncy boldness. 

After four exhilarating films, The Hunger Games empire does not crumble but comes to a full scale halt as it understands the allegory claims for the distrusting contemporary times we all live in regarding the cynicism, abuse of privilege and the underestimation of the weary masses being led astray by the controlling elite of unassuming movers and shakers. The audacity of The Hunger Games odyssey was to get down and dirty about the give-and-take tendencies of a global society willing to challenge the authoritative scrutiny or kneel at its merciless ankles. Perhaps Mockingjay--Part 2 should not be perceived so deeply in its final revelation. Nevertheless, the effort in trying to do so should be acknowledged for an actioner that dared to approach such thought-provoking fodder within its bombastic boundaries.

Andres Gomez,"The movie is not bad directed and the cast does a decent job. Actually, the script is a good adaptation of the book.

The problem is that the story of the book is already quite bad and has gone down the sink by now so the whole movie just doesn't work."
Reno,"> A necessary finishing touch with an unnecessary lag.

If the single book 'The Hobbit' was extended to three movies, then that's alright, because that was a large concept with hundreds of unique characters which can take the stretch in narration. But for this series, lucky to be the first film to get away with a big hit, mainly because of teen audience.

Honestly, I liked the 2nd film very much, but the third movie was a letdown, especially this one was utterly useless. Because the 80% of the story ended in the previous part and in this, it was a necessary finishing touch with an unnecessary lag.

Might have been a better film if the 'Mockingjay' was a single movie. Nowadays there are many strange ways to make money, the art of storytelling in the movies is slowing vanishing while adapting a book for the silver screen by splitting them into two and/or three. This culture has to stop, the book fans are enjoying the original masterpiece, while film fanatic like me is suffering a setback. In this 2 hour long movie there are lots of scenes that simply wastes time to bring sufficient runtime.

Due to the circumstances that I mentioned, the flow was disturbed, mainly because of the release gap between the last two films. Emotions are not felt, actions were weakened, you could only recognise it rushing towards the conclusion. And that section should have been the ultimatum, what comes later is what we call 'happily ever after or the other way' should have been very brief, but in here it was not. Like a new beginning of a new story, it went on too far.

From the screenwriter's perspective that has to be done. I had seen the split movies like 'Twilight', 'Harry Potter' and others, but this one was the worst among them. Even if you try all the four movies in a single sitting, the first two will be the best you can get and the followed two would surely disappoint you because of the slowness.

5/10"
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"Well, that was rather disappointing unfortunately. Not that I can say that I am very surprised though. The first installment in the series started off being ""okayish"" and the rest of them slid downwards towards mediocrity.  This, the final installment, is a notch below mediocre as far as I am concerned. I really cannot understand all the hype about these movies. None of them really shines even if you try to look at them as young adult movies which they really are.

This one was downright boring. There were numerous scenes where Katniss or some other character was just dreaming away or sitting around brooding. It took quite a while for anything to start happening in the movie.

When something started happening it was the same mess of political, unbelievably stupid, propaganda, messy and unintelligent fight scenes, Katniss walking around looking, I do not really known, disconcerted, sad, disturbed, whatever.

How the chief villains (yes plural) was one could figure out without too much effort. The moment the flyer came into the picture and started to fly over the refuges and the children not only I but all of my kids as well guessed who had sent it.

There is really only two things that I liked about this movie. One is that Donald Sutherland was really good. The other is the ending which, although being 100% predictable, was quite satisfying. Well, that scene (everyone having seen the movie knows which scene I am referring to) is where I consider the movie to have ended. After that it was only boring filler scenes remaining."
CinemaSerf,"So, finally - we reach the denouement. The ambitious and devious President ""Coin"" (Julianne Moore) thinks that the District 13 rebels have the upper hand, and so using ""Katniss"" (Jennifer Lawrence) as their poster girl, sets off to storm the very heart of the Capitol and depose the now very much weakened ""Snow"" (Donald Sutherland) who is, clearly, not in the best of health. What now ensues are a series of set-piece, occasionally morale-building but entirely predictable escapades that I have to say by now, I had really lost interest in. Who did what to whom in this overlong and really pretty procedural franchise was really beginning to matter less and less. What made the characterisations interesting and quirky at the beginning now just makes them rather dull. ""Peeta"" (Josh Hutcherson) features sparingly as he needs rescuing from the nasty government who are clearly drugging him up to his eyeballs and using as their Lord Haw Haw figure whilst hunky ""Gale"" (Liam Hemsworth) has little more to do than outrun some rather clunky special effects, some extras from an as yet unmade ""Alien"" film and look good wet - a task he manages well enough now and again. It's an action movie, so no point trying to scrutinise the merits of the dialogue. Otherwise, this was more of a relief than an enjoyment. At last the series could take a much deserved cat-nap."
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"As usual the so-called critics wrote it down quite a lot but the reviews by ordinary people gave it a much better score (although not stellar). Not very surprising of course since those self-proclaimed besserwissers always moan about films made just to entertain.

I found the film well worth the time and money spent. Of course the plot was not very intriguing but is there anyone who would really expect that from a film like this? It’s clearly aimed at younger people and people with a liking for magic and old-fashioned adventure. The effects where really nice and I certainly liked the old-fashioned magic theme. The fact that the lead actor was Nicolas Cage of course helps a lot as well."
r96sk,"Good enough, if nothing standout.

<em>'The Sorcerer’s Apprentice'</em> is an interesting film. The premise isn't anything revolutionary, it follows the same beats that a load of these sorta films do; I recall <em>'Bulletproof Monk'</em> and <em>'Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief'</em> having similar-ish set-ups.

That's not to say it isn't enjoyable, as I did like it. Nicolas Cage always manages to entertain one way or another, while Jay Baruchel works well for the comedic stuff in particular. Alfred Molina makes another live-action Disney appearance, following on from <em>'Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time'</em> two months prior. He's solid, but better in the latter.

The special effects are excellent, I really enjoyed seeing it all come to life onscreen. The score is decent, though the pacing could've been finer. Overall, it's a film I just about feel satisfied with. Worth a watch? Sure."
CinemaSerf,"Aside from an entertaining scene with some of Lukas' wonderful ""L'Apprenti Sorcier"" and some overly enthusiastic mops, this is a really poor adaptation of this Arthurian legend. In days of old, ""Merlin"" manages to imprison ""Morgana"" (Alice Krige) inside a sort of Russian doll. It falls to ""Balthazar"" (Nicolas Cage) to keep it safe over the millennia until the successor to the sagely old wizard emerges. Well it does, in the unlikely guise of the rather geeky ""Dave"" (Jay Baruchel) and so it falls to the former to train the hapless latter in the arts of sorcery. Meanwhile, the nasty ""Horvath"" (Alfred Molina) is bent on releasing the witch from her captivity, and aided by a Billy Idol style rocker ""Drake Stone"" (Toby Kebbell) is hot on their trail. To be fair, the intention is good - there is plenty of quickly-paced action, the visual effects are adequate and it really looks ok. The acting, though, is pretty terrible. There isn't the slightest hint of a spark between Cage and his young protege; Molina as the suave and ruthless ""Horvath"" falls fairly flat and the rest of the cast really just serve to clutter this up. Apart, that is, from Kebbell who is having a little fun. The dialogue is unremarkable, and at ten minutes shy of two hours, this is also just way too long. Pity. It has the resources to be good - just let down by the imagination of Messrs Cage and Turteltaub."
John Chard,"I wouldn't put a lot of faith on what the captain says. I'm an architect, and these boats weren't designed to float upside down. 

After playing water games with ""The Perfect Storm"" six years previously, director Wolfgang Petersen returns to the water to reimage 1972's ""The Poseidon Adventure"" (novel by Paul Gallico). Story essentially finds a cruise liner capsized by chaotic weather and survivors try to make their way out of an upside world before the boat either sinks or the inrushing water drowns them.

The original is one of the highlights of the disaster genre that burst forth in the 1970s, so it really didn't need remaking, but Hollywood insists on remaking old films for cash cow purpose. As it is, this is hardly a terrible movie, it lacks character development, the plot is stripped bare without any additional depth, and ultimately it's the CGI effects (that do work handsomely enough and were Oscar Nominated) that carries the picture to just above average status.

Hardly a must see disaster film but enough excitement and suspense to make it a dent time waster for fans of the genre. 6/10"
Reno,"**Alice returns to the wonderland for a new adventure.**

Based on the nearly 150 years old children's book, and a sequel to the 2010 film. Its quite a long gap for a follow up film, but the original cast has returned and directed by 'The Muppets' famed filmmaker. So, I was not expecting it since I considered the first film an average. All I wanted was a normal live-action 'Alice in Wonderland' films, but I disliked this weird make-ups and large head characters. In that perspective, this one was much better. Still, this is not the best, but definitely a lot better than the previous one.

A simple adventure story with nice graphics and performances. The Alice returns to the Wonderland for a new adventure where she has to cross the layers of the present, past and future. So in one word, this is a time travel theme in the fantasy genre. Mia Wasikowska ruled it, she was everywhere. She overran all other characters and takes the toughest challenge to achieve impossible.

Nearly a two hour journey into wonderland might make happy for little kids. Because it did not look like a normal fairytale, but very modern. This is not the Disney's best film, so I don't think there will be any more sequel. I want it to be rebooted, but not any time soon, at least a decade of gap needed. So I hope they won't rush and ruin this classic tale like three 'Spiderman' reboots in less than 20 years. Meantime, this film is okay for watching once, though I'm not in favour to recommend it to anybody except little children.

_6/10_"
r96sk,"A step down from the 2010 film, but <em>'Alice Through the Looking Glass'</em> is a solid film nonetheless.

I enjoyed seeing this plot, largely about time, play out. The film is CGI heavy, but does look great for the vast majority. The cast are good, with Mia Wasikowska leading well and surrounded by the likes of Johnny Depp, Anne Hathaway, Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen.

I do think the film could've been slightly shorter, with better pacing and less emphasis on the 'real world' stuff featuring Alice. The looking glass entry isn't as interesting/magical as the rabbit hole, also.

Far superior to the 1998 adaptation of this 1871 Lewis Carroll novel, that's for certain."
Andres Gomez,"I really was expecting very little from this movie, but I was surprised. Good action and quite a decent story. Not all fresh, but well put together.

I think the biggest pity is the lack of talent of Fimmel. He learnt how to perform for Vikings and he lays another flat copy of the same character.

Positive points to the very good OST by Djawadi."
moparchris,"Even if you have never played ""Warcraft"" or ""World of Warcraft"" before,
I think you will like this movie. It has a great story, good acting &
is visually stunning. The special effects are not over the top, but are
very good & believable. Do yourself a favor & don't think of this a
another ""video game movie"", see it & you will love it & want another to
be made. I hope this turns this into a great franchise, there are too
many good stories in the ""Warcraft"" universe waiting to be told on the
big screen.  Some non WoW fans might have a hard time following the fast paced story, but watch it again if you missed it & you will understand it more. I think there could have been a bit more character development & the addition of a narration track might help non Warcraft fans understand a little better, I hope they will do a little better on the sequel."
Reno,"**One fights for their new home and the others to defend theirs.**

I never played Warcraft game in my life, nor read comic book, but I enjoyed this new fantasy universe. Azeroth is the world where this story takes place. When the Orcs planet was destroyed, they use a magic portal to get to Azeroth and make a safe home. But that is where humans and other intelligent species live peacefully. A new race means a new conflict to solve the differences. So the battle commences at no time to gain the power to rule the land. Between the two great powers, who wins is the film to tell us in the rest of the parts.

It was something like 'Avatar' and 'The Lost of the Rings' coming together. Despite having alien race, it is very much an action- fantasy film, not a sci-fi. From the games to film, it was awesomely made which is obviously a latest trend in the filmmaking. The graphics were good, but not perfect, and that's fine, because it succeeds to give the game look than the realistic one. I think that's the point, otherwise no disgrace to call it was inspired by the games or comic book.

I know it is not a masterpiece like 'The Lord of the Rings', but there's a promise like the quality and story and its characters. There's no big names, but these actors who are known mostly for their supporting roles has given their best. Like I said I'm new to this Warcraft universe, so I don't know anything outside this film, but I'm kind of neutral on the war between the humans and orcs. Because one's world was destroyed and they're seeking a new home and the other ones are defending theirs. So everything makes sense from both the perspectives for their actions.

This is just a beginning, there's lot more sequels to come. Though, it's a pity that it failed in America, the native product, but internationally proved it is one of best of its kind, I mean games to screen adaptation. The director of 'Source Code' did a great job and all the actors, including those motion-capture artists. I missed Zoe Saldana in this, to be as another blue or green skinned alien specie, instead Paula Patton did well in a similar role. The character name also very similar to the one from 'Guardian of the Galaxy'. I know it's going to get even bigger in the follow-up, so I can't wait for it. Hope it will release in less than couple of years.

katch22,"The beginning is confusing and poorly acted, but it gets better as it goes.  The CGI looks seamless with the live-action."
Skarfrael,"A good fantasy movie, a bad video game movie (27 February 2017)

The day it premiered, me not being a wow fan or anything, i went and watched it, a mere fantasy lover who just couldn't resist not coming in contact with something new and promising. Hands down, even if i didn't know anything from this lore, through the movie i couldn't hold a grin all over my face. I don't know why maybe cause i was seeing before me a fantasy world well established. A world that probably deserved it. I left the cinema over-excited. I started playing the game, and more importantly i started reading the novels.

First come the Rise of the Horde(RoH), describing the durotan's life, gul'dan's rise to power, the fall of draenor etc. Second would be the Last Guardian(TLG) establishing Kadhagar, Garona, Medivh and Lothar. The third one, Tides of Darkness takes place after the death of Llane and the fall of Storwind, so the movie should sit between novels 2 and 3. And it is between those that i decided to rewatch the movie, now more experienced in the World of Warcraft.

To my sadness, i was disappointed. My once 8.5/10 rating fell to 5.5. Althouth the CGI was again THRILLING, the story was honestly RAPED. Reading TLG i noticed that the movie i had watched months ago, had changed some, but damn after rewatching it, i just couldn't stand it. There were some huge changes that honestly served no reason! For example why on earth Stormwind didn't fall? or why did the alliance exist already when it should not? why Orgrim was a Frostwolf? why Lothar's character was so damn wrong?? I hated movie-Lothar! I understand that the movie being made for non wow fans too, should be changed a bit, but come on... Video game movies should be more close to the lore! Even more than book-only fandoms! And me saying that, i am twice a reader than a gamer! For one, if they couldn't make a proper movie of the coming of the horde to azeroth then they could very well start from RoH story. It has the content to support a great fantasy movie. Works that end up lesser than they should, are disappointing."
CinemaSerf,"I had fairly low expectations for this, and I wasn't really disappointed. Based on a highly complex game structure, the characterisations seem to be drawn from a Tolkien meets Arthurian world in which magicians, guardians, orcs, humans and Glenn Close are all vying for power. What ensues now is a pretty straightforward tale of betrayal and manipulation with a bit of romance and plenty of visual effects that must have caused no end of boredom for an almost comedic Travis Fimmel, Ben Foster, Dominic Cooper and many others who must have been dangled, stood, sat or made to pretend-fight in front of a green screen for most of the production process. The fight scenes are relentless, colourful and creative, but they all go on for far too long with each ugly great beastie trying to wrestle another to the ground in the face of some terrible green glowing eyes that are trying to impose the ""fel"" magic on the kingdom. It is not a terrible film, though it is too long, it's just all about the technology and very little about a coherent piece of entertaining cinema that could have delivered much more had the screenplay worked harder with the undoubtedly promising opportunity for fantasy storytelling."
Gimly,"Some people have said that _Terminator: Genisys_ is disrespectful to its source material (first two films) but I disagree. Out of what is clearly a massive homage to _Judgement Day_, _Genisys_ gives away the entire plot and central “twist” in its promotional material months before its release, just like _Judgement Day_ did!

All levity aside, _Terminator: Genisys_ is not great. They took some risks with their casting and it didn’t explode in their face which is nice, a lot of the effects were very visually impressive, and it was fun to see the weapons of the future be purple lasers again, but these aren’t things that make a good movie by themselves. When you mix them up with a plot that doesn’t completely make sense, a story that’s just plain not all that great, some hammy dialogue and a lacklustre ending, then you SPOIL YOUR OWN DAMN MOVIE IN THE TRAILERS **AND** POSTERS, then you’re lucky to even be coming away with a middle of the road score like this one.

At least it’s not _Rise of the Machines_.

_Final rating: ★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
Matt Golden,"In the immortal words of Col. Kurtz, ""The horror...the horror."" Marlon Brando wasn't speaking of this film, of course, but rather the horrors of the Vietnam War. The sentiment remains applicable.

When I write reviews, I do try to give at least a modicum of context, be it a history of the film itself, predecessors to its place in cinema history, or my general feelings on the type of film. In this case, I've just referenced Francis Ford Coppola's classic take on Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness,"" Apocalypse Now. What does that have to do with Dawn Treader? Nothing, and I couldn't be happier. Why? Because it's distracted my mind with thoughts of a far, far better film. Allow me my few moments of happiness before I have to rifle through the dark filing cabinet of my mind to marshal my thoughts on this atrocity.\

What went so wrong here, you may ask? We'll start with the history of this franchise. I do not have the highest opinion of this series. We started out with the most famous of C. S. Lewis' Narnia cycle, The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe. I don't know...perhaps if we hadn't been in the middle of such a fantasy film renaissance, I would have found it more palatable. Instead, coming on the heels of Peter Jackson's generation-defining Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the high class and quality of the Harry Potter franchise, that weak take on a book series that didn't thrill me as a child struck me as a cheap, childish appetizer compared to the magnificent feasts audiences had already been served, their stories facile, their acting (aside from a typically great Tilda Swinton) either poor or phoned-in (Paging Mr. Neeson, your paycheck is waiting for you). SHREK co-director Andrew Adamson was the helmer of both Wardrobe and Caspian, and I had hoped those film's failings were due perhaps to his inexperience as a director of live-action. The first film of course wore its Christian allegory on its sleeve (Lewis, for all his writings, never managed to find the definition of ""subtle""), and it found favor with the churchgoing crowd, whose turnout afforded it a huge box office windfall. The second film was more of a straight actioner (in the vein of Star Wars Episode I, which is to say the supposed action was mired in a swamp of facile and achingly dull political machinations), and didn't find purchase with the same demographic, and box office returns were disappointingly low. Disney, who had financed the films, saw the writing on the wall, and dropped the series. That should have been the end of it.

Until 20th Century Fox stepped in. Now, let's remember: Fox doesn't have the best track record with adapting beloved fantasy series into films (a moment of silence for the tragedies that were The Dark is Rising and Eregon, please). Hiring Michael Apted as the director seemed to be bucking the trend of shoveling out crap. Apted isn't really known as an action, fantasy, or epic film director, but he showed promise with the last Pierce Brosnan/James Bond film, The World is Not Enough (I'll not blame him for Denise Richards'...nuclear physicist...sigh). Still, director in place, 20th Century Fox and Walden Media cobbled together another Narnia adventure, and the results were predictably terrible.

Honestly, I wish I hadn't expected a poor film going in. Because this film not only met but exceeded my expectations of terrible, and it's not because I was pre-judging it. It's because it was simply that bad. The plot is nonsensical, randomly shunting characters from one loosely-connected vignette to the next, with hokey dialogue and dire predictions of eeeevil standing in for actual menace or intrigue. It's a shaggy dog road trip story, waterlogged on a boat, and I found myself half an hour in wishing desperately that the characters would all get scurvy and die.

The plot's so thinly-sketched that I may as well not even try to recount it here, but it has something to do with two of the kids from previous films being once again pulled into Narnia at absolute random, with no thematic or plot reason for any of the nonsense in the first place. Once there, our cast is rounded out with their exceptionally annoying cousin, and despite no one knowing quite what's going on, they stumble upon the titular character of the second film, Prince Caspian, and join him on his completely random quest to recover seven old friends of his long-dead father who disappeared for some reason, and no one knows why. So they fight an island made of evil. Good wins, evil is defeated, the end. Please, let it be the end.

Listen: I love fantasy. I love science fiction, I love horror, I love all of the outré genres, the fantastic, the unreal. It fascinates me, and I love wrapping myself in the trappings of the genre like a favored blanket, letting their comforting warmth wash over me in waves of escapism and nostalgia. But this half-assed bunch of hokum had me rolling my eyes, with the stilted dialogue and the hastily-sketched characters and the nonsensical plot and the ARGH it's too much.

The icing on this crap cake was the ham-handed, in-no-uncertain-terms Christian allegory with which the film beat the audience over the head with all the grace, power, and strength of an industrial-size sledgehammer. Yes, the evil was SIN. And Aslan is JESUS. Who exists as a lion in an alternate universe or something, apparently. Who pulls children into this alternate universe at random for...no apparent reason whatsoever (the film explicitly states that it's ""to know Him (Aslan i.e. Jesus, in case you didn't already pick up on that) better,"" but if that's the case, why just these four kids? What's the thematic point of this? Why were the elder kids now judged worthy of not having watery allegory poured down their throats again? What did these kids learn at the end of this film that made them better people?

ARGH again. I cannot even begin to catalogue the problems with this series, from either the internal ""logic"" of the series or the external logic of the human brain. Doing so only hurts my head.

Remember how I said the second film in the series lacked the ham-fisted Christian allegory of the first? Well, 20th Century Fox apparently recognized the church-going demographic was what made the first film such a success, and had them ramp up the religious content from ""allegory"" to ""explicit yelling at the audience and rubbing its nose in it like it's a puppy who peed on the carpet."" This sentiment struck me as wholly insincere, a manufactured ""message"" shoehorned in by a film studio who wanted nothing more than to reap the box office rewards of the first film which felt, though unsubtle, genuine in its intentions.

I've seen films more poorly shot, more poorly acted, more poorly assembled. But this boring, useless, preachy slog with no purpose or point had me at the absolute end of my rope. Rare is it that I sit in a darkened theater constantly looking at my watch, biding my time, aching for the dross on the screen to end so that I simply don't have to endure it anymore. But that's exactly what happened with this film.

Before anyone jumps on the obvious point of attack, let me say in no uncertain terms that I am Christian. But (and this is an exceptionally important point) just because a the message of a particular film/book/song/etc. is Christian doesn't make the work inherently good. Nor does criticism of the work in some way equal an anti-Christian sentiment. I often feel that works perceived as ""Christian"" get a free pass on quality because of their message, but quality doesn't work like that. Lowering one's standards results only in mediocre pablum like this continuing to be passed off for media conglomerates to make a quick, insincere buck. Do me a favor. If you've enjoyed these films, fine. I whole-heartedly disagree, but I'm certainly not going to tell you you're wrong for enjoying them. But I beg of you: Don't shut off the critical area of your brain just because something agrees with your worldview. Doing so is a disservice not only to yourself, but everyone else like you who has to suffer through trash like this."
talisencrw,"Growing up in the Canada in the 70's and 80's, I fondly recall vastly enjoying an animated version of Lewis' 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' that was presented by Kraft on CTV. Now as a father of a son, I want to see with him the contemporary versions of the books I adored in my youth, though at present I greatly prefer the craftsmanship of cinema pre-1970.

It never bothers me in the slightest, to the ire of my more obsessive-compulsive cinephilic friends, seeing films of series with complete disregard to their order (one of my friends nearly had a heart attack, when he discovered I had watched 'Spider-Man 3' without having previously watched films 1 and 2--don't even get me started about the 'Harry Potter' series...), so, especially curious about how one of my favourite contemporary directors, Michael Apted, would do in the realm of big-budget, CGI-intensive fantasy filmmaking (I expected a fish-out-of-water, like Lord Richard Attenborough helming 'A Chorus Line'), I gave this a shot.

I enjoyed this more than 'Harry Potter' films I have seen, though it does stretch things from the literary works, but unfortunately, that seems to be the way things are, since film became less about artistry and more about business (just see at Toys R Us how many possible toys you can purchase, and similar commercial off-shoots, and I don't even consider this series a major player in this sort of area, because of its Christian undertones, which really doesn't mesh perfectly with selling tons of toys, though of course the realms aren't mutually exclusive, not by any stretch of the imagination). I think that Apted did a decent job, especially considering that yes, he is a fine director, but this isn't really his cup of tea. I distinctly feel that if these films are your comfort food, you won't be disappointed. I look forward to checking out the series' two preceding entries, and, though they left an opportunity for more films, which I believe wouldn't be from Lewis' works at all, it was a nice summation at its conclusion.

Finally, it was great to see (or at the very least, hear) Tilda Swinton, Liam Neeson and Simon Pegg, they seem to be thrown in everything these days. I heartily salute their agents--they must have the very best in the business."
r96sk,"I wouldn't class this as a good or bad film, it's in a weird sorta in-between to me.

<em>'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'</em> is, comparatively, bad. It loses the vibe and all the intrigue that the first film has, as it continues the downward trajectory set by the other sequel. However, it's still just about got a decent adventure feel to it.

Only two of the youngsters reprise their roles 'properly', those being Georgie Henley (Lucy) and Skandar Keynes (Edmund). I'd always prefer a cast to remain the same, but if I'm honest this doesn't miss William Moseley (Peter) and Anna Popplewell (Susan) all that much. That argument is helped by the arrival of a young Will Poulter as Eustace. He's great.

Plot-wise is where it gets meh. I didn't care for it, even if I did like its swashbuckling nature. I can see many finding enjoyment with it, but for me it doesn't quite come out positively unfortunately - it's sluggish. The ship set also feels rather cheap.

Not at all a bad film; one that was interestingly made without the involvement of Disney, Walden Media joined up with Fox instead. I just couldn't find enough entertainment in it."
John Chard,"OK! Lets not beat around the bush, it's historically suspicious, badly written, badly cast and clearly an hour too long. A splendid ""support cast"" are wasted as Michael Bay and his production team think they can produce some sort of Titanic of the Skies like epic and fail in their objective. By the time of the brilliantly constructed assault by the Japanese on Pearl Harbor, and ""it is"" exhilarating and edge of the seat heart pounding, you are left with the feeling that all the main characters in the piece are not really worth our emotional investment.

It's not an outright stinker, situations such as the nurses trying to cope in the hospital during the attack are poignant, and there's a jingoistic - cum - romantic fervour that screams out that the film wants to be genuine in making you feel, well, emotionally battered. However, given the budget and time you are asked to invest in the story, it's impossible not to feel cheated as the clock ticks past the three hour mark.

Perhaps it's unfair to use Titanic as a template for this type of epic? Especially since over the course of time many have come out of the woodwork to knock Titanic when previously there were nods in appreciation for it, all be it grudgingly. But Pearl Harbor just doesn't have enough about it to make it even a ""time waster"" recommendation, and this even allowing for some quality ""Bayhem"" action as the film rolls into its blunderbuss third quarter. 5/10"
CinemaSerf,"After about half an hour, I started to wonder if this film was going to take as long to get going as a pearl takes to form in an oyster! It's a close run thing, as it must be around eighty minutes in before the Japanese come to the rescue of the audience and introduce some action into this over-long and dreary romance. Certainly it is all handsomely presented with Ben Affleck (""Rafe"") at his most swarthy as he gets it to together with ""Evelyn"" (Kate Beckinsale). Having put us through the usual ""how to get the girl"" shenanigans, though, he heads off to the UK to help in the Battle of Britain. It's from here that reports reach her that he has been killed. Enter his best friend ""Danny"" (Josh Hartnett) who tries to console her before, well you can guess the rest. You can also easily guess that Affleck was being paid way too much money to be out before the fighting began in earnest, so back he duly arrives and a yawn-making love triangle takes over the plot. When we finally do start to focus on the events of December 7th, 1941, the action partially redeems this film. Twenty minutes of a quickly paced depiction of the meticulously planned destruction of the US Pacific fleet that caused mayhem and carnage upon their ill-prepared quarry. The creative use of CGI and intricate photography illustrate well both the human catastrophe as well as the significant destruction of materiel. Of course, our two survive and together with their erstwhile CO ""Doolittle"" (Alec Baldwin) are drafted into the retaliation plan than involves a perilous, long range, bombing attack on Tokyo to demonstrated that they still have the capacity for potent response. This is two films, really, and I much preferred the later stages. Even then, though, it has a shockingly poor script and the characterisations are weak and undercooked. The technology is used well, but that's about all I can say for this sentimental and meandering offering."
Per Gunnar Jonsson,My wife picked this one up together with the weekly TV magazine. Luckily we didn't pay full price. I hoped for a film about one of the greatest warlord of all time but what I got was something about a crying homosexual wimp.
John Chard,"Alexander Revisited: The Final Cut.

Alexander is directed by Oliver Stone and Stone co-writes the screenplay with Christopher Kyle and Laeta Kalogridis. It stars Colin Farrell, Val Kilmer, Angelina Jolie, Jared Leto, Anthony Hopkins, Rosario Dawson, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Christopher Plummer. Music is by Vangelis and cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto.

Alexander is an historical epic based on the life of Alexander the Great.
Off the bat I have to say that this ""Final Cut"" version of the film is the only one I have seen. Upon its initial home format release - the first theatrical version - I lasted an hour and 15 minutes before growing restless and sought enjoyment elsewhere. Consequently as a massive fan of historical epics through the years, it has been a constant nagging itch for me to see Alexander in its entirety. So with Oliver Stone tinkering away with versions - convinced he has made a worthwhile epic - I finally delved in.

The Final Cut, as far as I'm aware, is a vast improvement on that savagely received theatrical release, well that is said by those who tried again instead of calling quits at the first production. Straight away I could see the difference, where once was a plodding first hour, now sits a vibrancy, with Stone seemingly saying that he can do great action and drama, just please hang around during all the historical chatter, sexual connotation, family strife and conquering machinations, and I will enthral you as a whole.

By his own admission, Stone reveals he took on a most complex historical character and in his eyes has made a film to befit such complexity. We get a splintered narrative, as we kick off with the crux of Alexander the Great, the leader, while Alexander's childhood and family forming is interspersed at various junctures. The battles are high in intensity and blood letting - exhilarating at times - but more crucially they let us engage with the tactical ""ahead of their time"" manoeuvres of Alexander the Great. This version mostly flows alright, and I got to feel how Alexander's mind was working in the process, even if come pics closure I didn't fully know the man.

Epically cast of course, some of them work, others not so much. Farrell's looked odd, in the way that Pitt's was in Troy (released this same year as Alexander), but apart from the accent issue he grows into the role and is fiercely committed. Jolie is just wrong for the role of domineering Olympias, worse still the scenes she does with Farrell are damp and threaten to derail the drama already built up. This latter point is more annoying given a great thread involving Dawson as Alexander's wife Roxanne is built up superbly, only to not be pulled until some drama very late in the play. The rest of the cast come through as ok for period flavours (expected for Hopkins, Plummer and Meyers, interesting as regards Leto).

This is not the life ambition masterpiece Stone wanted to make, even if he proclaims on the extras that he's happy and content with The Final Cut version. This cut still shows some cracks, but these are not seismic enough to hurt the film. For there's a lot of grandeur, blood stirring and thought gone into the production, and there's a lot to be said for that in this day and age of soulless cash making filmic exercises. Honourable failure then? Yes for sure, but a better film in this form than some may have thought possible back in 2004. 7/10"
Wuchak,"_**Alexander’s conquests from Greece through Persia into northwestern India**_

After being tutored by Aristotle (Christopher Plumber), Alexander (Colin Farrell) takes over the Macedonian throne in 336 BC at the age of 20 after his father is assassinated (Val Kilmer). Over the next 13 years he, amazingly, conquers the Persian Empire and heads into India before finally turning back. Anthony Hopkins narrates as Ptolemy in his old age while Angelina Jolie plays Alexander’s snake-loving mother. Rosario Dawson plays his wife acquired in Bactria (in what is today part of Afghanistan).

Oliver Stone’s “Alexander” (2004) was a challenging undertaking and has many attributes despite not being as compelling as the contemporaneous “Troy.” It’s a colorful, entertaining epic with a great cast, awesome battle scenes, exotic locations/sets and a fine score by Vangelis. Naturally the storyline is not as one-dimensional as “Troy” seeing as how it involves a movable empire traveling across western Asia.

Historically-minded critics complain about the sequence where Alexander's fatigued soldiers request not to push further into India in favor of returning to Macedonia to see their families again. Alexander denies their request and does something that paints him as an unreasonable tyrant. In real life Alexander pondered their demands for a few days before agreeing to turn back and didn't execute anyone, which showed what a compassionate, merciful leader he was. However, this dubious sequence was simply Stone’s amalgamation of several mutinies during his conquests, which was placed at that particular point in the story for dramatic reasons. Besides, the movie certainly illustrates how Alexander brought the light of civilization to his foreign subjects and was accepting of their cultures, wanting to unify the many tribes under one banner, so to speak.

The scenes with Val Kilmer as Alexander’s father are entertaining while the ones with Angelina Jolie get boring after the first two or three. We get it: she loves snakes, hates her husband and thinks Zeus was Alexander’s father. Half of the sequences with Jolie could’ve been cut with no harm done, which would’ve helped momentum.

I didn’t have an issue with Alexander’s relationship with his childhood friend, Hephaistion (Jared Leto), since it’s clearly depicted as platonic in the sense of David and Jonathan in the Bible (see 2 Samuel 1:26). In the film the two are depicted as having a loving friendship wherein they occasionally hug and that’s it. I occasionally hug my best friend too, but I only sleep with my hot wife. 

As far as Alexander being bisexual, there’s zero historical proof of this. Yes, the kiss between Alexander and Bagoas (Francisco Bosch) was mentioned by Plutarch who lived in the Roman Empire 200 years later but, assuming it happened, it doesn't mean much. Some cultures in history kissed on the mouth when greeting, like Russians; it’s a social tradition and has nothing to do with sexual desire. To put it in perspective, imagine a filmmaker saying Trump was gay 2327 years in the future even though he had numerous women, marriages and children in his life. It's slanderous and can be attributed to Stone's catering to Liberal propaganda as opposed to historical reality. In short, he played the homosexual card to be ‘hip’ and give his movie Lefty ‘edge,’ but it backfired because it bombed at the box office. Still, the scene in question is brief and all it suggests is that Alexander experimented with homosexuality once after partying which, let’s face it, is something Greeks are known for (although Alexander would argue that he’s technically Macedonian, lol).

If you can ignore that glaring flaw, there’s a lot to appreciate in “Alexander” since Stone is unquestionably a top-of-the-line filmmaker. And the flick certainly inspires viewers to look up the real history.

The film was shot at Pinewood Studios & Shepperton Studios, both just west of London, as well as Morocco and Thailand (it’s pretty easy to figure out which scenes were done where).

There are no less than four cuts of the film available: The theatrical cut runs 2 hr 55 min (175 min); the 2005 Director’s Cut runs 2 hr 47 min (167 min); the so-called Final Cut from 2007 runs 3 hr 34 min (214 min); and the 2013 Ultimate Cut runs 3 hr 27 min (207 min).    

GRADE: B-"
John Chard,"Front and Centre for Dumbledore's Army.

Term 5 at Hogwarts for Harry and the gang and it's a deeply unsettling time. Harry faces getting expelled and finds himself shunned by many around him. This at a time when the Ministry of Magic compounds his misery by insisting to all and sundry that ""you know who"" is not back again.

Given that JK Rowling's fifth book is considered to be something of a door stopper, a book more of interim Potter filler than any great amount of substance, credit has to go to new to the franchise director, David Yates. For Yates and his screenwriter Michael Goldenberg have managed to craft a briskly entertaining segment in under 2 hours and 20 minutes of film. Yes it's safe to say that it ultimately does feel like an interim filler movie, one that is for fans and not newcomers to the series, but the effects are superb (except Grawp that is), the action is much and suspense is not in short supply. While it also finds Radcliffe as Potter finally hitting his acting stride.

New into the magical fray comes the wonderful Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbrage, the sort of cheery psychotic teacher we all had bad dreams about in our formative years. Also most welcome is Helena Bonham Carter as nut job harpy Bellatrix Le Strange, it's an appetiser of substance and we can't wait to see some more of her from here on in. Of course the usual problem of not enough screen time for the regulars still exists, but it's now become a figure of grumpy acceptance in the grand scheme of Potter World. Neatly keeping the story trimmed of extraneous fat, Yates doesn't disappoint in delivering a last quarter as memorable as any so far in the series. Big rewards await those who wait, because the showdown that crowns Order of Phoenix is a magical mêlée of wands and wonderment; a face off between good and evil, a free for all that joyously assaults the senses.

Roll on Half-Blood Prince, where it's great to know that Yates has been further entrusted with the Harry Potter reins. 7.5/10"
John Chard,"Do not do so lightly! If chosen, there's no turning back. As from this moment, The Triwizard Tournament has begun!

Year four at Hogwarts for Harry Potter and his chums, and it's a time of change, chance and danger. The prestigious Triwizard Tournament is being hosted and the applecart is turned upside down when Harry, unqualified and underage, is selected by the Goblet of Fire to be one of Hogwarts' competitors. If the thought of competing in such a dangerous tournament wasn't scary enough, Harry also has the worry of finding a date for the Yule Ball to contend with! 

The Prisoner of Azkaban set the marker for a darker, more grown up Potter picture, a high standard that Goblet of Fire, and new director Mike Newell, arguably had no hope of attaining. But it's not for lack of trying, and in fairness Newell and the team have managed well enough to blend the blackness that comes with the impending arrival of Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes), with the burgeoning ping of teenager hormones. There's an awful lot going on here. With the Triwizard Tournament comes two groups of exchange students to Hogwarts in the form of the glamorous girls of Beauxbatons Academy, and the hunky boys of Durmstrang Institute. The arrival of which sends Ron, Hermione and co into blushy flustered awakenings. The tournament itself (rightly) dominates much of the film, the lead up to it and the three challenges that the competitors have to face, with Harry's dragon face off a bona fide excellent piece of film. Then on to the fall out of the tournament where it gets real dark and the film and series lurch on to another level and set up the next installment a treat. 

As is customary for a Potter film, there's also a number of new characters and replaced characters in the mix, while major story developments flit in and out of the narrative to the point you really have to pay attention completely. Of the new arrivals it's Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody (Brendan Gleeson terrific) who is most telling and enjoyable, but tabloid scribe Rita Skeeter (Miranda Richardson) is something the film could have survived without. Yes it's a nice pop at the gutter press, but watching it now, would the time spent wasted on Skeeter not have been better served on the sadly under filmed Quidditch World Cup? Especially considering the build up to it is magnificent. Or at the very least some more Malfoy Senior, Sirius or Snape! But the disappointment felt there is offset some by the wonderful Yule Ball, where Newell is in his element gleefully dangling his charges through the joys and sorrows of awkward awakenings. It's a series highlight that's not to be missed.

A film of variable pace due to the makers trying to juggle so much, it's ultimately something of an up and down viewing experience. That said, Newell is able to dazzle the pre-teens with his set pieces, because the kiddies sure as hell will not understand the angst and hormonal issues present, while the rest plays out on adult terms. So something for everyone, then. It may not be successful as a whole, and newcomers dipping in for the first time get no guidance at all, but it's still a ripper of a ride for those who are into the films having not read the books. It's set up nicely for part 5, but pity poor David Yates in the directing chair for Order of the Phoenix, though, for that is one hell of a door stopper novel to try and condense down into an entertaining Potter movie! 7/10"
Nathan,"_Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_ is an absolute spectacle. I am a huge sucker for tournaments in films and this hit every single note for me; intensity, stakes, creativity, it is all there.

Our main cast is doing some of the best acting of the series, Daniel Radcliffe really raises his performance up a notch and establishes himself as the lead of the franchise. His acting is refined and mature and he does an excellent job portraying his emotions with not only his line delivery but his facial expressions and body language. He really broke through here and it was a joy to see. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were great, but they had a slight decrease in screentime and really were sidelined during this film. The introduction of Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory brings an interesting dynamic to the story, as Harry Potter has somewhat of an older brother figure to contend with. The relationship and chemistry between the two builds and brings some emotionally heavy scenes throughout.

There is constant action in this film; from the opening scenes of the Quidditch World Cup to the multiple rounds of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, there is always something happening, and it helps create a very steady pace throughout. Not only is there action, but there is also fantastic character development. All of our characters really start to come into their own through the struggles they all face throughout the film. Harry is the best he's ever been, and the new faces are great on screen. Alastor Moody is mysterious and quirky and is a great mentor to Harry.

But the greatest thing about this film is the sinster introduction of Lord Voldemort. His presence was lurking in the background of the entire series, but here he is reborn in a horrifying way. Ralph Feinnes is superb in his only 6 minutes of screen time, but it is enough to leave a lasting impression. The ending is perfect and sets the tone of the franchise going forward.

While the cinematography and tone might be better in Prisoner of Azkaban, I cannot deny that this movie is better in almost every other aspect, which is why it gets a slight nod.

**Verdict:** _Excellent_"
Aakif,"I loved it and I would **rate** it 5/5 for the best child’s fiction <a href=""https://www.scholarlywriteups.com/charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory/"">book</a>. Why? Because it has lessons, we all need to learn. We have become so materialistic and driven with the energy of getting everything fast, we have lost the essence of our lives and the importance of kindness. It’s a book you not only want to gift to your kids, but you want to read yourself as well."
John Chard,"It's not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me.

Bruce Wayne is constantly tortured by his childhood memories when he witnessed his parents being murdered. Taken under the wing of The League Of Shadows, a deadly ninja assassin army devoted to erasing crime with their own brand of harsh justice. After completing training, Wayne refuses to join them on account of not agreeing with their methods, he returns to Gotham City to reek his own one man war against crime.

Director Christopher Nolan literally goes back to Batman origins to not just give the dead franchise a kiss of life, but actually to spark it into a sort of triumphant homecoming. Gone is all forms of camp veneer so evident in Joel Schumacher's offerings, and in place we have a darkly rich picture intent on fleshing out Batman's motives, and crucially, his fractured persona.

One of the most pleasing things to me was that Nolan paced this picture to perfection, the build up of character, and then birth of the Bat, dominates for practically the first hour of the piece. This gives Batman Begins some crucial heart, it really helps us to focus on this weird super-hero now that we have some meat on his bones. We then follow Wayne from a Chinese prison to The League Of Shadows monastery, watching his transformation from brawling man of anger into a controlled fighting machine. A machine that still roams with a revenge laden heart.

Then its to Gotham City where he then births Batman and all bad guys are on his agenda. Mob boss Falcone, the mysterious Scarecrow, and also a face from his past that rears its surprising head. Wayne is driven by powerful motives, and it's here in the second part of the film that Batman Begins rewards those who indulged in the character build up. In come the stunts and outrageous sequences, all played out in Nolan's desperately dank Gotham City (a far cry from Tim Burton's dark Oz like scapes). This Gotham is pot boiling to disaster and is crying out for the Bat to sweep all before it, and thankfully Nolan and his cast fulfil all the early promise to deliver a wonderful action fantasy that caters for all ages.

Christian Bale dons the Batsuit and it fits like a glove, his Bruce Wayne may lack the ebullient charisma that Michael Keaton's had, but his Batman is mean and moody and comfortable with the zippy dialogue. Michael Caine plays Alfred the loyal servant to the Wayne family, much heart and emotive drive from Caine ensures the role is a roaring success. Cillian Murphy is Dr Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow who actually scares more as Crane with his piercing eyes and devilishly smirky leer, whilst both Gary Oldman (Jim Gordon) & Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox) are solid with what little they actually have to do. Liam Neeson gets his teeth into a meaty role as Henri Ducard, and as a character arc he gets the best scenes (Nolan clearly having great fun here).

Minnor let downs to me without hurting the picture are Katie Holmes (pretty but hardly convincing as Assistant D.A. Rachael Dawes) and Rutger Hauer as Earle (a little bit of menace wouldn't go amiss here Rutger old man). Still, as I said they are very minor let downs because as comic book adaptations go, Batman Begins is from the top draw, a franchise re-suited, rebooted and completely reinvigorated. But now the test comes with that all important sequel... 9/10"
molleigh,"i'm beginning to think people only say a movie is good because of it being long and having a good camera. to me the only highlight was cillian murphy's performance. the rest of this was just some dumb, boring trek."
NoxiousScythe,"Christopher Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" shows us exactly how Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) transforms into the caped crusader we all know and love, Batman. Admittedly like many others, even though this is the first entry in the Dark Knight Trilogy, I watched it is as my last one, and that is due to me not even knowing of it's existence, which is thanks to it being heavily overshadowed by the critically acclaimed sequel, ""The Dark Knight.""

Batman Begins has a simple plot to follow full of twists. A young Bruce Wayne travels to the Far East, where he's trained in the martial arts by Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), a member of the mysterious League of Shadows. Ducard later reveals the true purpose of the League, the complete destruction of Gotham City as they feel it is an unjust cesspool full of criminals that is too far gone to be saved and must be cleansed to preserve their duty and for justice and balance to be restored. Bruce does not agree with the League's morals and returns to Gotham on his own determined to clean up the crime-ridden and corrupted city without resorting to murder. With the help of his loyal butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), a tech expert at Wayne Enterprises, Batman is born.

The number one takeaway from this film that I did not experience as much in any other Batman movie, was that it really makes you care and feel compassion towards Bruce Wayne himself, not the masked vigilante he disguises himself as. The real Bruce is tragic, realistic, relatable, quite unstable, and frankly doesn't know what his purpose is or what he should be doing with himself. This is the origin story, and you get to first hand see the traumatic events that turned him into the lonely, guilt ridden bitter man you see today. His feelings and actions are completely justified, and I've gained a lot of respect for the character.

Now this is a dark, gritty and mature film clearly made for adult fans, do not expect the colorful, campy comic book styled ""Joel Schumacher"" treatment here, this is going to get real, real fast. I can and do appreciate the attempt to not be a generic superhero film and head towards the crime drama genre, and don't get me wrong it's a great movie, but there a few issues that keep it from being perfect movie status like the sequel in my books. It was maybe a bit too serious for it's own good, and ends up being so focused on becoming an art piece that it almost stops being fun. Primary antagonist Ra's al Ghul is great, but secondary villain Dr. Crane a.k.a. Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) has an apparent lack of quality visual effects and proper screen time. The long run time was not wasted, but they probably did not need to include so many side characters, world building and lore into what could have been a quicker, neat, well done origin story.

Overall I liked and can get behind Batman Begins, I do not think it's the best in the ""Dark Knight Trilogy,"" but it's a top quality film on it's own accord especially if I stop comparing too much. This film delivers a uniquely cold, cruel, and memorable experience that will make you see and appreciate Bruce Wayne and his Batman persona from a completely new perspective."
AstroNoud,"‘Batman Begins’ is a strong introduction to the Batman thanks to the magnificent cast and a superb score by Zimmer and Newton Howard.

CinemaSerf,"Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale are at the top of their games with this enthralling interpretation of just how ""Batman"" came to be. ""Bruce"", the young sone of the billionaire ""Wayne"" family finds himself unexpectedly orphaned and is soon aimlessly bumming his way around Asia. It's when he encounters ""Ducard"" (Liam Neeson) and is lured high into the Himalayan mountains that he is set to training by the legendary Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) so that he can join the ""League of Shadows"" - an uniquely skilled ninja-esque group of elite warriors. He plans to use his training to return to the largely lawless Gotham City and act as a force for good. Soon, though, he learns that all in his highland sanctuary is not what it seems and after a battle royale, finds himself back at his manor house with his faithful retainer ""Alfred"" (Sir Michael Caine) and at the helm of his company - just as it is about to be sold by ""Earle"" (Rutger Hauer) making him an even more immensely wealthy man. His scientific guru - a sort of equivalent of ""Q"" - is ""Lucius Fox"" (Morgan Freeman) and together with the like-minded police officer ""Gordon"" (Gary Oldman) they set about taking down the city's kingpin ""Falcone"" (Tom Wilkinson) before he can contaminate the water supply with an opiate that will bring wholesale fear and destruction. This is a cracking action adventure film that rarely has a dull moment. Nolan and accomplished writer David S. Goyer take this character by the scruff of the neck and it really works. No more silly thwacks and pows; this is a dark and gritty tale of corruption, jealousy and revenge that is superbly photographed and has gadgets galore. I did struggle with Wilkinson, to be honest - he has all the menace of a wet cabbage; and Katie Holmes's ""Rachel"", though providing additional humanity, sadly offers little as this plots twists and turns like a cobra on steroids. Certainly never my favourite super-hero, ""Batman"", but this is certainly up there as one of my favourite superhero films. No laser eyes or magnetic powers; just a decent man with vengeance on his mind."
Andres Gomez,"Baaaad ... oh, baaaaaad.

Hugh Jackman is always great as the Wolverine but this story doesn't have any sense nor excuse."
tmdb44006625,"I watched this film and felt like they shot it without an actual script, filming whatever came to mind. And what do you know, I found out later that they really didn't have a script to follow.

Makes sense now why many scenes feel rushed or incomplete, most of the effects look half rendered, and ""Deadpool"" looked like an absolute disaster.

And yet, oddly enough, it's not the worse film in the X-Men franchise. It just sets the bar exceedingly low."
r96sk,"Just about passable.

I never felt bored while watching <em>'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'</em>, which is why I can't give it a lower rating. The action is well done and it gives the satisfactory amount of enjoyment, shame the CGI isn't quite up to scratch though. As with the preceding three <em>'X-Men'</em> releases, I really do enjoy watching Hugh Jackman as Wolverine - he is certainly the best thing about these films.

With all that noted, the film does definitely have issues. I didn't overly like the new characters and the plot didn't truly fulfil what I was expecting/wanting from an origin story, even if it is fairly fun to watch. Elsewhere, Ryan Reynolds is introduced as his well known character, I look forward to seeing more of him in the role - here, he's fine.

Four films in and there's a slow decline ongoing, hopefully <em>'X-Men: First Class'</em>* at least regains footing with the opening two productions. <em>*I'm watching these in release order.</em>

/copied directly from my Letterboxd review\"
CinemaSerf,"I have always struggled to engage with the ""X-Men"" franchise, but had higher hopes that this - featuring the most charismatic of them - might change that. Sadly not! ""Logan"" (Hugh Jackman) has a healthy rivalry with his brother ""Creed"" (Liev Schreiber) honed after their birth in the middle of the 19th century. Many years later, though, and somewhat battle weary, they are offered the opportunity by ""Stryker"" (Danny Huston) to join his elite team of mutant commandos. Disillusioned with this, ""Logan"" drops out and tries to live a normal life with his new found love. ""Stryker"" is having none of this and so after the inevitable tragedy, battle lines are drawn as the angry ""Wolverine"" sets out for revenge. Some of the other ""X-Men"" characters feature as this meanders along, and there are a few very well-made up appearances from Ryan Reynolds (""Wade Wilson"") but for the most part this a weakly constructed and dreary action drama with an over-reliance on CGI as the combat scenes recycle themselves all too often. Jackman tries hard, and he does impose himself on the story - but there is little sense of jeopardy and the nature of his ""quirk"" ensures that the acton scenes, though frequently at close quarters, are all rather repetitively predictable. The production standards are high, but the rest of this is immediately forgettable. Sorry."
NeoBrowser,"And so the much-hyped Year Of The Matrix comes to an end. Truthfully, though, the real Year Of The Matrix was 1999, when the groundbreaking original proved to be the right film in the right place at the right time. Tapping into the cultural zeitgeist and Y2K fears about the power of machines over mankind, The Matrix not only revitalized slo-mo action sequences with its 'bullet-time' style, it had a political relevance that already seems dated in a 21st century world dominated by a war against terror, not technology.


The Matrix Reloaded, for all its faults, did try to up the ante, both in its creation of a wider Matrix myth and its budget-heavy effects. Revolutions, however, is content to follow in its wake, the final couple of hours of a four-and-a-half hour slab to which the original movie, in the makers' minds, is but a pre-title sequence. Granted, there's less philosophical babble and more emphasis on action in Revolutions, but the Wachowskis, having backed themselves into pseud's corner, can only deliver with a formula where spectacle and pretentiousness follow on from each other in steady succession. Gut thrills and intellectual stimulation are never integrated as one.


Revolutions' sustained action set-piece - the Sentinels' attack on Zion - is undeniably exciting, but it sure doesn't feel like an episode from a close sequel to the original Matrix. For a start, Zion was off-screen for the entire first movie. Secondly - and dramatically more importantly - this centerpiece relegates the main characters to, at best, mere bystanders. Neo and Trinity are off on a mission of their own. Morpheus - now dressed in what looks like a burgundy Benetton jumper rather an outfit consistent with his standing as the coolest dude on (or under) the planet - takes a literal backseat to Niobe's driving. Instead, the key players are the Kid, whose backstory is apparent only to those dedicated enough to watch The Animatrix cartoons, and Mifune, whose on-screen impact is unfortunately as brief as it is memorable.


That such a primary scene is completely filled with secondary characters isn't just disappointing - it's damaging, because it draws attention away from the protagonists' climactic acts. Basically, this is the bit you remember, more than Neo's vital conversation with the Wizard Of Oz-like face of the machines or his up-in-the-air fisticuffs with Smith (a fight whose sfx impact has dwindled following Reloaded's Burly Brawl).


Some viewers will indeed be completely satisfied, their questions answered, as the final credits roll, but they're the ones who have done their homework. Without filling in plot gaps by watching The Animatrix or playing derided computer game Enter The Matrix, a sense of confusion reigns. And those who are confused can't emotionally engage with the characters, thus rendering any amount of sacrifices and love themes null and void. In the original film, the casual viewer could relate to a slave race of pod people and their need to be freed, but the Wachowskis seem to have moved the goalposts as the story has progressed, sidelining what began as a focal point of the plot.


In other words, few box-office-storming blockbusters have been aimed so consciously at such a narrow and precise cult audience. The Year Of The Matrix will be remembered as an indulgence for fans, while the original movie will be affectionately held as a separate entity by a bigger crowd.


Verdict - What once represented the future of science fiction cinema has become little more than a solid genre offering. But, hey, it wasn't supposed to be the Second Coming, was it? Oh, hang on...

3/5

- Empire Magazine"
junijubiroke,"""Frozen,"" the latest Disney musical extravaganza, preaches the importance of embracing your true nature but seems to be at odds with itself.

The animated, 3-D adventure wants to enliven and subvert the conventions of typical Disney princess movies while simultaneously remaining true to their aesthetic trappings for maximum merchandising potential. It encourages young women to support and stay loyal to each other—a crucial message when mean girls seem so prevalent—as long as some hunky potential suitors and adorable, wise-cracking creatures also are around to complete them.

It all seems so cynical, this attempt to shake things up without shaking them up too much. ""Frozen"" just happens to be reaching theaters as Thanksgiving and the holiday shopping season are arriving. The marketing possibilities are mind-boggling. And in the tradition of the superior ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Little Mermaid,"" surely ""Frozen: The Musical"" will be headed to the Broadway stage soon. The songs – which are lively and amusing if not quite instant hits—are already in place. 

Little girls will absolutely love it, though. That much is undeniable. And the film from co-directors Chris Buck (""Surf's Up"") and Jennifer Lee is never less than gorgeous to watch. A majestic mountaintop ice castle is particularly exquisite—glittery and detailed and tactile, especially as rendered in 3-D.

But first we must witness the tortured backstory of the film's princesses – not one, but two of them. The script from ""Wreck-It Ralph"" co-writer Lee, inspired by the Hans Christian Andersen story ""The Snow Queen,"" has lots of cheeky, contemporary touches but is firmly and safely rooted in Scandinavian fairy tale traditions.

When they were young girls, sisters Anna and Elsa were joyous playmates and inseparable friends. But Elsa's special power—her ability to turn anything to ice and snow in a flash from her fingertips—comes back to haunt her when she accidentally zaps her sister. (Not unlike the telekinesis in ""Carrie,"" Elsa inadvertently unleashes her power in moments of heightened emotion.) A magical troll king heals Anna and erases the event from her memory, but as for the sisters' relationship, the damage is done.

Elsa's parents lock her away and close down the castle, which devastates the younger Anna. (Of the many tunes from ""Avenue Q"" and ""The Book of Mormon"" songwriter Robert Lopez and his wife, Kristen Anderson-Lopez, the wistful ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman?"" is by far the most poignant.) But once they reach adolescence and it's Elsa's turn to take over the throne at age 18, the two experience an awkward reunion.

The perky, quirky Anna (now voiced by a likable Kristen Bell) is a little nervous but overjoyed to see her sister. The reserved and reluctant Elsa (Broadway veteran Idina Menzel) remains distant, and with gloved hands hopes not to freeze anything and reveal her true self on coronation day. But a run-in with an amorous, visiting prince (Santino Fontana) who sets his sights on Anna triggers Elsa's ire, and she inadvertently plunges the sunny, idyllic kingdom into perpetual winter.

Flustered and fearful, Elsa dashes away in a fit of self-imposed exile – which significantly weakens ""Frozen,"" since she's the film's most complicated and compelling figure. On her way to the highest mountain she can find, Elsa belts out the power ballad ""Let It Go,"" her version of ""I Am Woman."" This soaring declaration of independence is the reason you want a performer of Menzel's caliber in this role, and it's the film's musical highlight. (Her flashy physical transformation from prim princess to ice queen does make her resemble a real housewife of some sort, however.)

Afterward, though, the story settles in on Anna's efforts to retrieve her sister and restore order to the kingdom. Along the way she gets help from an underemployed ice salesman named Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his trusty reindeer sidekick, Sven. They all meet up with a singing snowman named Olaf (a lovably goofy Josh Gad, star of ""The Book of Mormon"" on Broadway) who dreams of basking in the warmth of the summer sun. This ""Wizard of Oz""-style quartet makes the obstacle-filled trek to the imposing fortress that awaits. (At least ""Frozen"" has the decency to borrow from excellent source material.)

While the journey may seem overly familiar, the destination has some surprises in store. Some come out of nowhere and don't exactly work. But the biggie—the one that's a real game-changer in terms of the sorts of messages Disney animated classics have sent for decades—is the one that's important not just for the little girls in the audience, but for all viewers. http://newmoviestream.co/watch/2294629/frozen
wish everything about the film met the same clever standard."
Andres Gomez,"I was excited to watch this movie after all the buzz about it but I've been a bit disappointed.

Yes, the animation is great and it keeps all the typical Disney details and is funny, sometimes. In addition, it features two strong female characters that don't need of a hero to save the story but ...

... but still they are the super-beautiful and perfect Disney princesses, as if they couldn't be normal girls from normal status, and the role of Queen Elsa is not that important as it would have expected.

Not a bad movie, but not the best and I think far from the fun I had with Tangled."
MSB,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)

Six years later, and Frozen has left an undeniable cultural impact. From Let It Go to tons of merchandising, Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee delivered such a memorable film that people not only didn’t forget but regularly asked for its sequel. As of right now, Frozen II has claimed the third-best animated opening weekend ever, proving that the love for this franchise (I think it’s safe to call it that already) is strong. However, how great is the original movie, after all? To be honest, I never fully watched it until this past week in preparation for its sequel. It surprised me in the sense that I didn’t expect to enjoy it as much as I did. Frozen is deserving of the love it possesses.

With extremely captivating characters, the story flows naturally, and the entertainment levels are always high. Whether these are due to the amazing singing sequences or to the exciting adventures, this film never stops having fun. That’s what Frozen ultimately is: a lighthearted, fun, and entertaining movie. It follows Disney’s formula for creating a variation of a story we have seen before. Characters go through a traumatic event when they’re young. They have to grow up while struggling with the aftermath of said trauma. Eventually, they overcome that obstacle and live happily ever after (or at least until the next installment).

It’s the generic and somewhat cliche Disney model for a new animated film (franchise). Nevertheless, don’t get me wrong: it works perfectly. Sure, it doesn’t bring anything new story-wise, but it’s still a great time. Despite some unnecessary and lazy exposition (the magical trolls are basically exposition devices), Frozen still delivers a truly captivating and visually jaw-dropping narrative. I do need to emphasize this: the animation is phenomenal. Elsa’s magic is seamless and beautiful. Arendelle is a gorgeous location, and the snowy mountains are impressively designed. Let It Go will always be remembered for its lyrics and melody, but the actual animated sequence is astonishing.

Every character carries a lot of expressiveness, which allows them to do basically everything. Frozen might not be a groundbreaking movie, but its compelling characters make the generic plot work. From Elsa and Anna’s complicated but heartwarming relationship to Kristoff and Sven’s camaraderie, I care about all of them… especially Olaf. I know, Olaf is simply the snowman version of a comic-relief character. He doesn’t really have a complex arc in need of extreme development. However, it’s impossible not to love him. He’s such a welcome presence in every single scene. Every single line of his is either a funny remark or a pretty valuable insight into something.

Counting him out, every other character has a very well explored arc, mainly Elsa and Anna. Their (older) relationship originates from a plot point that might be a tad exaggerated, but it’s convincing enough. Finally, the score is as important as it is fantastic. It’s an animated musical, let us not forget about that. Obviously, Let It Go is the queen of all songs due to its catchy lyrics, memorable chorus, and significance to the character. But other ones such as Do You Wanna Build a Snowman and For the First Time in Forever also carry a sweet melody plus some exquisite character and story development. That’s what I love the most about musicals and why Disney always triumphs regarding this aspect: the way a simple song can tell so much about someone or move the plot forward. In my opinion, it’s the genre’s variation of “show, don’t tell.”

In the end, Frozen might not be a groundbreaking animated film story-wise, but it delivers around 100 minutes of pure fun and entertainment. With an exceptional voice cast (Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell, and Josh Gad are wonderful), Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee are able to take Disney’s formula and create a worthy variation of the classic blueprint. From the emotionally compelling and well-developed characters to the eyegasmic animation quality, Frozen is a good time from start to finish. Boasting some memorable and catchy songs, it became one of the decade’s culturally most impactful animated movies. I wish exposition wasn’t overused, and that more risks were taken concerning the screenplay, but as a Disney animated flick, it meets the company’s standards.

Rating: B"
JPV852,"Great animation and good voice talent, however pretty weak story but ultimately entertaining enough movie. Also found the music, outside of the song ""Let It Go"" (which was played to death for the past several years now) were rather forgettable and bland. **3.0/5**"
r96sk,"One of Disney's best, in my opinion. Not quite top tier, but very close.

<em>'Frozen'</em> really did blow up when it was released, and rightly so. Sure it probably got overhyped but that isn't the film's fault. It's a cracking watch, the pacing is absolutely spot on as are the musical numbers.

What impresses me the most about the music is that it manages to keep the storytelling alive whilst it occurs. Particularly at the beginning there are loads of songs squeezed in next to each other, which could mess with the premise building but it doesn't - it actually enhances it. The songs themselves are terrific, with ""Let It Go"" obviously getting the most plaudits.

Idina Menzel (Elsa) and Kristen Bell (Anna) are excellent in the lead roles, while Josh Gad almost steals the show as Olaf - very funny character! Of course it's aimed at the younger audience members, but it is still entertaining for us adult folk too - I've watched it a few times down the years and still thoroughly enjoy it."
CinemaSerf,"OK, so it took me ten years and a persistent nephew to finally sit down before this, and though I didn't hate it, I really did struggle to see what all the fuss was about. It's a colourful adaptation of Hans Christian Anderson's ""Snow Queen"" story that sees Queen ""Elsa"" leave her kingdom after she almost kills her sister ""Anna"" - she has the ability to turn all before her to ice and that can be perilous at times for those around her! As she flees, upset, she accidentally leaves all in her kingdom with a rather frosty predicament. It now falls to ""Anna"" alongside her friendly snowman and her reindeer to try and get this pesky curse lifted. It skips along amiably enough with plenty of charming animation - especially from ""Olaf"" the snowman, but it's really about that one song that Edina Menzel delivers with a skill that, for my money anyway, is comfortably the best of these anthemic Disney power-ballads. I'm not sure even legendary lyricists Don Black and Richard Stilgoe have ever managed to incorporate ""fractals"" into their songs! As with so many of HCA's fairy tales, there is a darkness to the story - this one sanitises these aspects a little too much for me, but that said it still deals with issues of fear and deceit well enough for folks to get the message that perhaps having a frozen heart is not just a physical thing. Ten years on, it's still a decent watch that I suspect will continue to sustain youngsters for many a year to come."
NeoBrowser,"Commander Lock: ""Not everyone believes what you believe."" Morpheus: ""My beliefs do not require that they do."" Characters are always talking like this in ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" which plays like a collaboration involving a geek, a comic book and the smartest kid in Philosophy 101. Morpheus in particular unreels extended speeches that remind me of Laurence Olivier's remarks when he won his honorary Oscar--the speech that had Jon Voight going ""God!"" on TV, but in print turned out to be quasi-Shakespearean doublespeak. The speeches provide not meaning, but the effect of meaning: It sure sounds like those guys are saying some profound things.

That will not prevent fanboys from analyzing the philosophy of ""The Matrix Reloaded"" in endless Web postings. Part of the fun is becoming an expert in the deep meaning of shallow pop mythology; there is something refreshingly ironic about becoming an authority on the transient extrusions of mass culture, and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) now joins Obi-Wan Kenobi as the Plato of our age.

I say this not in disapproval, but in amusement. ""The Matrix"" (1999), written and directed by the brothers Andy and Larry Wachowski, inspired so much inflamed pseudo-philosophy that it's all ""The Matrix Reloaded"" can do to stay ahead of its followers. It is an immensely skillful sci-fi adventure, combining the usual elements: heroes and villains, special effects and stunts, chases and explosions, romance and oratory. It develops its world with more detail than the first movie was able to afford, gives us our first glimpse of the underground human city of Zion, burrows closer to the heart of the secret of the Matrix, and promotes its hero, Neo, from confused draftee to a Christ figure in training.

As we learned in ""The Matrix,"" the Machines need human bodies, millions and millions of them, for their ability to generate electricity. In an astonishing sequence, we saw countless bodies locked in pods around central cores that extended out of sight above and below. The Matrix is the virtual reality that provides the minds of these sleepers with the illusion that they are active and productive. Questions arise, such as, is there no more efficient way to generate power? And why give the humans dreams when they would generate just as much energy if comatose? And why create such a complex virtual world for each and every one of them, when they could all be given the same illusion and be none the wiser? Why is each dreamer himself or herself, occupying the same body in virtual reality as the one asleep in the pod? But never mind. We are grateful that 250,000 humans have escaped from the grid of the Matrix, and gathered to build Zion, which is ""near the Earth's core--where there is more heat."" As the movie opens, we are alarmed to learn that the Machines are drilling toward Zion so quickly that they will arrive in 36 hours. We may also wonder if Zion and its free citizens really exist, or if the humans only think so, but that leads to a logical loop ending in madness.

Neo (Keanu Reeves) has been required to fly, to master martial arts, and to learn that his faith and belief can make things happen. His fights all take place within virtual reality spaces, while he reclines in a chair and is linked to the cyberworld, but he can really be killed, because if the mind thinks it is dead, ""the body is controlled by the mind."" All of the fight sequences, therefore, are logically contests not between physical bodies, but between video game-players, and the Neo in the big fight scenes is actually his avatar.

The visionary Morpheus, inspired by the prophecies of the Oracle, instructed Neo--who gained the confidence to leap great distances, to fly and in ""Reloaded"" destroys dozens of clones of Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) in martial combat. That fight scene is made with the wonders of digital effects and the choreography of the Hong Kong action director Yuen Wo Ping, who also did the fights in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" It provides one of the three great set pieces in the movie.

The second comes when Morpheus returns to Zion and addresses the assembled multitude--an audience that looks like a mosh pit crossed with the underground slaves in ""Metropolis."" After his speech, the citizens dance in a percussion-driven frenzy, which is intercut with Neo and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) having sex. I think their real bodies are having the sex, although you can never be sure.

The third sensational sequence is a chase involving cars, motorcycles and trailer trucks, with gloriously choreographed moves including leaps into the air as a truck continues to move underneath. That this scene logically takes place in cyberspace does not diminish its thrilling 14-minute fun ride, although we might wonder--when deadly enemies meet in one of these virtual spaces, who programmed it? (I am sure I will get untold thousands of e-mails explaining it all to me.) I became aware, during the film, that a majority of the major characters were played by African Americans. Neo and Trinity are white, and so is Agent Smith, but consider Morpheus; his superior Commander Lock (Harry Lennix); the beautiful and deadly Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith), who once loved Morpheus and now is with Lock, although she explains enigmatically that some things never change; the programmer Link (Harold Perrineau); Link's wife, Zee (Nona Gaye), who has the obligatory scene where she complains he's away from home too much, and the Oracle (the late Gloria Foster, very portentous). From what we can see of the extras, the population of Zion is largely black.

It has become commonplace for science fiction epics to feature one or two African-American stars, but we've come a long way since Billy Dee Williams in ""Return of the Jedi."" The Wachowski brothers use so many African Americans, I suspect, not for their box-office appeal, because the Matrix is the star of the movie, and not because they are good actors (which they are), but because to the white teenagers who are the primary audience for this movie, African-Americans embody a cool, a cachet, an authenticy. Morpheus is the power center of the movie, and Neo's role is essentially to study under him and absorb his mojo.

The film ends with ""To Be Concluded,"" a reminder that the third film in the trilogy arrives in November. Toward the end, there are scenes involving characters who seem pregnant with possibilities for Part 3. One is the Architect (Helmut Bakaltis), who says he designed the Matrix and revises everything Neo thinks he knows about it. Is the Architect a human, or an avatar of the Machines? The thing is, you can never know for sure. He seems to hint that when you strip away one level of false virtual reality, you find another level beneath. Maybe everything so far is several levels up? Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time tells the story of a cosmologist whose speech is interrupted by a little old lady who informs him that the universe rests on the back of a turtle. ""Ah, yes, madame,"" the scientist replies, ""but what does the turtle rest on?"" The old lady shoots back: ""You can't trick me, young man. It's nothing but turtles, turtles, turtles, all the way down.""

Per Gunnar Jonsson,"There have been plenty of movies based on classical cartoon superheroes that have been poorly implemented and with a lousy story. Luckily this one is not one of those. This was really a very enjoyable movie and I liked this movie a lot better than the first Thor movie which I felt was mostly silly.

This one has a story which was rather okay and held somewhat together. You have to remember that this is a comic book hero and the story is on that level of course. The special effects and the scenery is really nice as well. The views of Asgard is cool, almost breathtaking.

Anthony Hopkins was excellent as Odin or Oden has he is called in Sweden, my country of birth. Tom Hiddleston is also very good in his role although I have to say that I really do not like his role but then he is supposed to be one of the bad guys so… Chris Hemsworth is good enough in his role but I would say that he is really the weakest ones in terms of acting.

The movie is liberally sprinkled with jokes as well and, thankfully, most of them are not too bad. Although a bit silly I have to say that I did laugh when Thor politely hung Mjölnir on the clothes rack in the apartment with Darcy and Dr. Selvig.

On the whole I enjoyed this movie tremendously."
Andres Gomez,"More of the same. Predecible non elaborated script and with a total lack of sense of humor.

The FX are, again, OK, but the feeling of swords, axes, armors and helmets is of cheap plastic."
DoryDarko,"Watching Thor: The Dark World tonight, I got the feeling that Hollywood might have finally figured it out. In theory, a sequel should always surpass its predecessor, although as we all know, many have tried and famously failed. But a new trend seems to finally be breaking through. X2 was better than X-Men. Spider-Man 2 was better than the first. And now that I've seen it, I can tell you Thor: The Dark World… is better than Thor. (And the fact that these are all Marvel productions, that's food for anther discussion.)

I thoroughly enjoyed Thor, directed by Kenneth Branagh, when I only saw it for the first time just this spring. In fact, I watched it again the same week. Which is saying enough to imply that my hopes were high for the sequel. So I was really looking forward to tonight and I was not disappointed.

Thor 2 was helmed by a different director, Alan Taylor, which typically always spells trouble in my book when they change the director, but I take my hat off to him. What I admire is that he managed to capture the tone that Branagh set in the first film flawlessly – even perfected it in a way. He brings to the table a duality which almost never works successfully in any film, but here, does so perfectly: Taylor made Thor 2 notably darker, yet at the same time more humorous. I take my hat off to the writers as well – they put in a ton of great jokes, all at the exactly right moment. Had this been done even a fraction less tactfully, the film would have sunk like a bag of bricks, like so many others have. I found myself (and the audience) laughing my butt off one moment, and feeling very serious and engaged with the on-screen emotions the next. Even when it happened abruptly, it still never felt inappropriate. Now that's good entertainment. Two thumbs up.

The actors all wear their roles like a custom-made suit. It's obvious that Chris Hemsworth has really grown into his character, third time around. This guy IS Thor, hands down. The same goes for all the other actors, they were all perfectly comfortable in their roles and respective environments. The one that intrigued me most, however, was Loki – personified absolutely magnificently by Tom Hiddleston. Much like Hemsworth, it seems he was born to play this role. He captures all the slyness, all the arrogance and all the torment of a man almost unable to bear the weight of his own ego in a single flicker in his eyes. And then that grin… Perfection. The way Hiddleston plays Loki is strangely captivating. You know he's totally wicked and cannot be trusted, yet at the same time you can't help but really like him – you might even end up rooting for this guy, and I'm not sure many other actors would have managed this.

All the special effects were as good as one should expect them to be these days. I have nothing much to say there, except that it was all terrifically eye-pleasing, and Asgard looked even more beautiful than before. It was all convincing and very well done. 

Still, I have not completely explained why T:TDW is better than the first. Actually, I might not fully be able to. It's mostly a feeling. As much as I was entertained the first time, I was even more entertained now. It was more action-packed, more exciting, darker and it just had a great deal more adrenaline. 

The only thing that I think was weaker in this film, was the character of Jane Foster. Her character was just less interesting, kind of blank. I actually don't remember much of her at all, except that she slapped Thor a couple of times and she had all this creepy stuff coming out of her… Also she was somewhat of a damsel-in-distress most of the time with the look of a scared kitten on her face, and that's not exactly how we like to see our ladies nowadays. It's so common to see women being perfectly independent now, that it's a little weird to see a grown woman with ""three degrees in physics"" (as Darcy so poignantly points out) scared and shivering like a little girl. Most of the time, Natalie Portman just didn't carry her scenes very strongly, and that's strange coming from such a fine actress. So maybe one of the actors was actually a little out of place after all, thinking about it. 

Having said that, that's pretty much my only complaint. Every other element in this film was very solid, the story was very good and they absolutely nailed the pacing. Those two hours went by in the blink of a eye. 

Thor: The Dark World is wonderfully entertaining and a definite must-see for every Marvel fan. In fact – at the risk of enraging the Marvel Gods – this might just be pretty stiff competition to X-Men… Watch out Wolverine, I think I have a new favorite superhero.
_(November 2013)_"
Gimly,"**A long format review from 2013**

Despite a virtually non-existent (comparatively) promotional campaign for Marvel’s latest effort, Thor: The Dark World has crushed its competition box-office-wise. Though receiving less critical acclaim than Captain Phillips or Gravity, it did clean up in the finance department.

I’ve made no secret of the fact that in the MCU, my favourite Avenger is Thor, so a new film was always going to be an easy ticket from me. And I can’t work out if that bias is making me more critical of the film because I care so much, or less because I’m just happy it got made? I’ll try to be as above board as possible.

Thor 2 is a spectacle, make no mistake. It has the appropriate mix of explosions, attractive people, monsters, humour, fighting, mesmerising visuals, sweet symbolism and heart-wrenching sorrow that can be expected from a decent super hero film. But beyond that, it doesn’t really have much.

I know it sounds like it has a lot, and it honestly does, but I just couldn’t help feeling in a quite a number of moments that the thing felt hurried. Maybe if there wasn’t such a mad rush to get a Thor sequel out by the end of 2013, they could have spent a little more time fleshing out and filling in the script (not that it’s a short movie, I mean the pre-production feels rushed) and better utilising director Alan Taylor (Game of Thrones, Rome, Carnivale). There was a hint of the generic, amongst this otherwise splendid film.

tmdb44006625,"Thor: The Dark World represents all of the MCU's worst tendencies: shoehorned humour at the expense of good scenes, a cookie cutter underdeveloped villain, and an over reliance on big outlandish explosions. It doesn't help that the story is also convoluted and lame, made even worse because it introduces the second infinity stone.

All in all, Thor: The Dark World is not a terrible movie. It's just far more cliché than its predecessors, and that's disappointing."
Justin Lopez,"I don't understand all the hate surrounding this movie. I loved every bit of it and somehow, to me, it feels like this was even better than its predecessor. Better CGI, a darker, sci-fi fantasy plot and improved action sequences make it a truly great sequel to the first film."
LoganWright,"Action sequences aside, this movie was a great sequel to the first film. So much character development for Thor and I just love how he reunites with the crew from ""Thor,” especially with Jane."
BradleyStewart,"One of the first Marvel movies I watched and though I don't know a lot yet about him, I can say that Chris Hemsworth plays Thor quite well."
Jane Hall,"Not as good as the first one. I had my hopes up the whole time as I was able to enjoy the first one,  but I guess it really is true that sequels always do worse than the originals."
JessieCollins,"Not as Thor-y as the first one but definitely gives Thor some character development which, let's all agree, he needs in order for him to establish better his role as one of the main heroes in The Avengers."
John Smith,Didn't enjoy it as much as the first one but watched it for the sake of keeping up with the timeline and making sure I wasn't missing any information critical to understanding the next Avengers movie coming out.
1RobertJohnson1,"Although acting was solid and the production value was still through the roof, I wasn't able to enjoy the movie. Probably because everything else sucked."
MichaelWilliams,What happened to the deep story and intelligence that was portrayed in the first Thor film?
WilliamJones,"If you're wondering why Thor: The Dark World is a title you're not familiar with, it's because you should just stay away from it."
DavidBrown1,"Boring,a typical plot of everyone else just relying on the main superhero to save the day."
JosephWilson,"Just stay away from this film. You'd be wasting your time. Mindless, boring plot with lazy writing."
richardmiller,You can clearly see that they got lazy with the writing on this one. Big insult to superhero fans and just Thor in general.
ThomasMoore,Marvel flopped! Probably their worst film for 2013. It was annoying and everything was just all over the place!
JeffreyYoung,"Still not a bad film. I personally enjoyed it more than the first Thor movie, but still not comparable to other Marvel films."
JacobKing1,The main villain was not that great but I don't think that destroyed the entire movie. There were still some great scenes and the storyline wasn’t all that bad.
Phileas Fogg,Fabulous action movie. Lots of interesting characters. They don't make many movies like this. The whole movie from start to finish was entertaining I'm looking forward to seeing it again. I definitely recommend seeing it.
Andres Gomez,"Good action movie with a decent script for the genre. The photography is really good too but, in the end, it is quite repeating itself from beginning to end and the stormy OST is exhausting."
extoix,Awesome movie!  WITNESS ME will stick with me forever!
Cineport,Fantastic action that makes up for some plot holes.
balumahendran,Wonderful action movie. Scenes are unimaginable. Lots of graphics used in this movie. This is totally a very good action movie.
simonTheDiver,"I was never a fan of the original Mad Max films but this one just blew me away. There was something so powerfully visceral about this on the big screen. It was a fun on assault on the sense , in a good way. Its spectacle rather than plot driven so may not fare as well on the smaller screen. Watch on the largest possible tv in a darkened room with the phone and other gadgets off. Crank up the volume."
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"I would say that this movie is pretty much the kind of movie that I expected it to be. That being said I think it was a bit softer than I hoped it to be. I think that, again, the Hollywood plonkers have opted to make a movie that got a more palate rating (to them and their cash registers) than what it should have been. It is not as obvious as with Robocop and a few other movies but the feeling is there.

It is still a fairly entertaining movie. It is of course yet another special effects movie and as such it does not disappoint. It differs from a lot of the usual special effects movies in that the effects are pretty down to Earth in a bizarre way. We are not talking about superheroes or near magical technologies here but instead we have a devastated landscape, scrounged together equipment and a totally ludicrous desire to blow up the last remains of human civilisation. The bizarre vehicle designs and the totally ridicules behaviour of a lot of people in this movie is alone worth watching it to be honest.

As with the previous Mad Max movies this one stretches the bounds of reality (I hope) when it comes to human behaviour and how they waste the few precious resources, specifically gasoline and bullets, that remains after the apocalypse. It provides some spectacular scenery but it also puts a bit of “what the f…” feeling to it all. Not that this part is not expected from a Mad Max movie though.

What I think was my largest let-down in the movie was the Mad Max character itself. To me he is supposed to be a real bad-ass. In this movie he was not really that impressive. He certainly was far from the original Mad Max character in my opinion and was really overshadowed by the Furiosa character. I could have lived with that if this character would have been really impressive but she was not. She was cool but she was still underwhelming when comparing to anything in the original bad-ass Mad Max universe. I would say that Tina Turner and Mel Gibson still rules!

Still it is a decent futuristic, apocalyptic action movie, maybe not living up to this old movie geeks expectations, but not at all a wasted movie evening. The sound track of the Blu-ray certainly gave my subwoofer an exercise as well."
Gimly,"**The following is a long form review that I originally wrote in 2015.**

I’ll keep this’n somewhat brief, because I only saw the movie once and it was a few days ago now. Some time later on though, I will post a spoiler talk that goes into greater depth. For now though, enjoy this spoiler free review of _Mad Max: Fury Road_!

The number one complaint I’ve been seeing about _Fury Road_ is that there’s not much of a story. I would respond by saying, there might not be as much story as you could **want**, but there is certainly as much as you could **need**. The plot isn’t deep, or complex, or intricate, or philosophical. but it’s there, and it makes sense. Just last year, _John Wick_ showed us that you can get away with a pretty thin premise, if you work hard enough on building a thick, palpable world. And the world of _Fury Road_ is something else entirely, I can see why people aren’t blown away by the story, but the world is incredible.

There has been much discussion as to whether Max himself, or his cohort Furiosa (played by Charlize Theron) is the star of the film. I would argue that neither of them are. Director George Miller is. This is his vision. Warner Brothers took a big risk when they handed a 70 year old man nearly two hundred million dollars to revitalise his franchise which has been dead for 30 years, then get out of the way and let him do his thing. But it paid off. _Fury Road_ is more of an “experience” than most movies are, it just happens to be a great film, too.

The stunt work and visual effects deserve praise all to themselves. According to the filmmakers, roughly ten percent of all the effects were done with CGI. The other NINETY are practical, and it oozes with that spectacle. You really can feel the maximum force of the future sitting in that theatre, which is a rare and unexpected pleasure.

It’s my highest rated film of 2015 thus far, in fact, it’s one of only five films I’ve given more than 4 stars in the past five years. So please don’t take the recommendation lightly when I ask you all to go out and support this movie. Just make sure you do it in the biggest, best quality cinema you can, because this latest entry to the _Mad Max_ franchise is worth it.

OzDrDj,"1 Star, solely for the fleeting Presence of the Interceptor. As for the rest, Nothing to do with Mad Max, just a cross country jaunt of constant silly action. 
As a Fan of the Original, Mel Gibson is Mad Max, an there will be no other. I have no idea what was going through anyones mind when they tried to tie this to the Mad Max Franchise, Probably not much. If the movie had just been called Fury Road, left Mad Max out of it, It may have been an interesting movie in its owb right, but I think it would have been laughed at and relegated to the $1.99 bin at your local service station."
Matthew Brady,"When I saw the reviews for this movie my first thought was ""Every critic has lost their minds... even me.""

The story is about a post-apocalyptic wasteland - the fight for survival has twisted the remnants of mankind, turning most into mad, vicious gangs. In this chaotic world two rebels may be able to restore order while seeking their own forms of redemption: Max, a man who just wants peace after losing his wife and child and Furiosa - who thinks finding her childhood home is the answer.

What a lovely day to be talking about Mad Max: Fury Road, because the trailers and the reviews for this movie have been off the walls mad. I mean five out of five star's! wow, just wow. The last Mad Max film came out in 1985, so it's a been a long time and so was this movie, as development took a long time. So I was curious and a bit shady for this movie, by seeing if George Miller (The director of the original films) was going to bring to the table. Now after seeing the movie and having a long thought about it, this movie is freaking awesome, no actually this is the best action movie of the year and probably the decade.

George Miller goes back to his roots and he doesn't disappointment. After all these years later he's still got it. He filmed all the action scenes with care and effort, because most of the action in this movie are mostly practical effects and that right there shows that Miller is going back to old school of action, and it's perfect. You are the man Miller!

The movie itself is mad and I do mean freaking insane. There's a guy in this movie who plays a flamethrower electric guitar on top of a speed vehicle and all through out the movie he was rocking it out. I don't know why, but little things like that made this movie so mad that it's enjoyable.

Tom Hardy as Max Rockatansky was good, I mean he wasn't as good as Mel Gibson but I still think he did a great job. Most of the time Max doesn't talk all that much, I mean most of he's lines are ""huh"", or ""Water"", but he has a couple of lines in the movie and it sounded epic all the time.

Charlize Theron (as Furiosa) is basically the main character and Max is the supporting character. Charlize Theron was like a female version of Max in a way, because her character steels the whole show as her character is a strong female bad-ass that kicks so much ass that it's very rare in action movies today to do that. Now think of all the strong female character's in past action movies, well that's Furiosa right here.

The action scenes can be best describe as incredible and freaking crazy. The stunt work used during the movie was f**king amazing. There actually used practical effects mixed with CGI during the action scenes which looked so good and much better than over using effect's to make something look incredible and I know they used some CGI for scenes where it needed it, because it would be too dangerous or impossible to do, but for the most part it's all practical effect's. NOW THIS IS HOW ACTION MOVIES SHOULD BE DONE! THANK YOU MAD MAX: FURY ROAD FOR DOING THIS!!! Okay, I had to get that out there and sorry for shouting.

Immortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays- Byrne), and yes he was in the first Mad Max movie, but here he plays a different villain this time and a menacing one as well. He was like a mix of Dark Vader and Sweet Tooth from Twisted Metal (Video Game). He was awesome villain that didn't take sh*t from anyone and always looked like he was going to cause a whole lot of trouble every time he's on screen.

The cinematography was just beautiful and some of the best looking shoots so far this year. I can't believe I'm saying that for a action movie that's been in development for years and it payed off perfectly. This is very rare for this to happen as a lot of movie franchises that have been in the making for years and years would normally come out to late where every body just lost interest and give up waiting, and the movie itself would turn out not so good, but here is much different. This movie broke new grounds of coming out late but still being a amazing thrill ride.

The other women in the movie know as the five wives are not just there to look pretty and be saved by any man, no they kicked ass in the movie and they actually did something. The five wives were strong women and this isn't just a mans movie, I mean most of the movie is the women kicking ass and being awesome. They kick more ass then Max ever did. That's why I got to give this movie praise for that.

Now for the problems: I tried to look for things that didn't quite work for the movie and to be honest I couldn't find anything that I thought wasn't good. Well there was some slow parts in the movie but the slow parts where the action clams down for now it fills it's time with character development and back story and it worked.

Overall rating: Forget ""Pitch Perfect 2"", this is the movie you should see at cinema. As a movie reviewer myself who wants action movies to be more then turn your brain off and enjoy whatever slob mess there in front of the screen, but what I want is a movie experience that I can look back on and say ""Now that, was one heck of a movie."""
John Chard,"George Miller brings us the fourth Mad Max film - Ultimate Carmageddon!

An apocalyptic story set in the furthest reaches of our planet, in a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken, and most everyone is crazed fighting for the necessities of life. Within this world exist two rebels on the run who just might be able to restore order.

George Miller directs and co-writes the screenplay with Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris. It stars Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zoë Kravitz, Josh Helman and Nathan Jones. Music is by Tom Holkenborg and cinematography by John Seale.

Well it was a long time in the making, but finally a fourth Mad Max movie was made and it proves to be worth the wait. Undeniably light on plot, this essentially is a two hour chase movie played out to an apocalyptic backdrop of green skies, scorched orange and red vistas and the sort of storms that usually only come in nightmares. 

Hundreds of crazily designed vehicles do untold damage to each other and to the barely human contingent - both goodies and baddies, the weaponary on show is vast and brutal, while the stunt work is breath taking. There's some narative stabs at redemptive force between Furiosa (Theron excellent) and Max (Hardy rightly restrained), but really this about high octane action and it's absolutely thrilling as Miller's camera work rarely sits still and brings all the carnage vividly to life.

A petrol head's love poem in live action form and an action junkie's wet dream, Mad Max is back, and this time there's also a glorious female side-kick of considerable tough substance. 9/10"
John Chard,"Faith is a gift I have yet to receive.

Angels and Demons is directed by Ron Howard and adapted to screenplay by David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman from the Dan Brown novel of the same name. It stars Tom Hanks, Ewan McGregor, Ayelet Zurer, Stellan Skarsgard, Pierfrancesco Favino, Nikolaj Lie Kaas and Armin Mueller- Stahl. Music is scored by Hans Zimmer and cinematography by Salvatore Totino.

Symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is summoned to Rome and asked by the Vatican to help when four cardinals are kidnapped. Upon examining a tape recording that announces that the cardinals will be killed one at a time hourly, Langdon places the crime at the door of the ancient Illuminati. It's a race against time to not only try and save the lives of the cardinals, but also to avert the detonation of an anti-matter bomb which will destroy Vatican City. 

In spite of The Da Vinci Code making gargantuan amounts of cash, there were many who actively hated the movie. Yet this follow up from Howard and his makers still enticed just under $500 million's worth of worldwide paying punters into see it. Ultimately it's a very different movie to Da Vinci, where that film was sombre and talky, and had a great religious hook that caused tremors in Christianity, Angels and Demons is a pacey race against time serial killer thriller. Albeit one that is still religion based and additionally topped up with some sci-fi gubbins. 

The ticking time bomb format works well as a cliff hanger and the narrative allows Langdon and his latest lady investigator, CERN scientist Vittoria Vettra (Zurer), scope for no-nonsense detective work. There's a good solid mystery story at the heart, one which doesn't veer to being over complicated, and the production value is of a very high standard. Casting is first class, with McGregor and Skarsgard complimenting the reliable, and thankfully new haircut sporting, Hanks. It's a little draggy in the mid-section, as history comes crashing into the mix and the makers feel the need to be cerebral, and the finale is bizarre if wholly appropriate, but herein lies the problem 

If you can judge it on its own terms, not as a Dan Brown novel recreation and a link to bad memories of Da Vinci Code (not me, I liked it well enough actually)? Then it's a film of simple pleasures. If not then it kind of goes without saying that you probably already dislike the movie! 7.5/10"
ohlalipop,The movie was not great. I don't like action movies that much but I'm expecting some good fighting scenes since this is a Marvel movie. I was disappointed. It was mostly talking and I don't understand half of what the actors were saying. I should watch this with subtitles next time.
Gimly,"**A long format review from 2011**

So, Thor has only been out for a week and a half, and already it’s grossed $100 million! Pretty fucking good considering it hasn’t even been released in America yet, where like, every movie ever makes most of its money. As you may have guessed, yes, I did finally get around to seeing le Thor, hence the delay in my review of The Incredible Hulk. But know what? Fuck you man! I just watched fucking Thor!!

So in case you couldn’t guess, I was rather damn impressed with it all. Why? Well boys and girls, strap your tolerance boots on, this one could get long.

The Computer Graphics were some of the best I’ve ever seen. Now I’m not one to believe that CGI is the sort of thing that could make or break a film, but having it be this fantastic goes quite a ways to helping out. I also was unfortunate in my having to watch it in 3D, and yet it was worth it. This is a pretty big statement from me. I despise 3D… I even walked out of the cinema not feeling nauseous. A tad headache-y sure, but that was it. So congrats Thor.

The comic relief was powerful. In that “funny but not silly” kind of way. I mean, it’s all a bit silly, but it would have been so easy to fall into the cheesy trap with this film. The writing team and director Kenneth Branagh (The Boat that Rocked, Sleuth, Hamlet) did a fantastic job of keeping the audience engaged  and not descending too far into shameless, lame, self-parody.

The characters of the film were written almost as strongly as they were in Iron Man 1 & 2, not quite, but they did have quite a number more to work through, so they couldn’t work with everyone as well as they did with Tony Stark and Pepper Potts. They also managed to totally pull off an American movie with romance and comedy, in a way that totally avoided those awful American Romantic Comedies (my least favourite genre in the history of ever).

There’s this whole thing where Thor comes from another world. Which was after all really the only way you could bring a God into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has been so grounded in reality. And I’ll tell you, Asgard (Thor’s home planet) was fucking great. They pulled off this crazy similarities in appearance between family members on Asgard, despite the fact that none of the actors are related. You may disagree with me on inspection of posters and whatnot, but after seeing the movie, you’ll get what I mean. Also the actors they got to play the younger Loki and Thor were eerily believable. Like, to an actually kind of scary point. I wonder if any of it was fake… The Frost Giant homeworld of Jotunheim is also visually stunning.

The sound effects were very confronting. I couldn’t really figure out if I though this was a good or a bad thing… It’ll be interesting to rewatch on DVD, and see if it was only so crazy because of the speakers in the theatre. Thor may have lacked the wholeness as a film felt by Iron Man 1 & 2, or The Incredible Hulk, but it was perfect as a lead up to The Avengers, which, now that it’s all set in stone, is really kind of needed. With Thor more than the other heroes it’s the most important, because there was really no way to humanise that sort of character, he’s just so outlandish that you really need an entire film just to ground him in this world they’re developing.

But all of the things I’ve had to say about the film were basically leading up to this one big thing; the cast! The cast was incredible, not only did they manage to snag a total of THREE of my favourite underrated actors ever, one of them just so happened to my favourite actor in the whole wide world, Ray Stevenson!

We have Australian (fuck yes Australia!) Chris Hemsworth (Home and Away [Hey! We all have to start somewhere, right?], A Perfect Getaway, Ca$h, Cabin in the Woods) playing Thor, Natalie Portman (Black Swan, V For Vendetta) playing Thor’s love interest; Jane Foster (lots of people have started having a problem with Natalie Portman nowadays, but I still love her), Anthony Hopkins (The Rite, The Wolfman, Beowulf, Red Dragon, Hannibal, The Silence of the Lambs [Yes, this is the same guy who played Hannibal Lecter. I fucking know, right!?] Bram Stroker’s Dracula) as Thor’s father; Odin, Stellan Skarsgard (King Arthur, Exorcist: The Beginning, Beowulf & Grendel, the Pirates of the Caribbean series, Angels & Demons) as Dr. Erik Selvig; Jane Foster’s mentor, Ray Stevenson (Rome, King Arthur, Outpost, Punisher: War Zone, The Book of Eli) as Thor’s friend, and member of the Warriors Three (above); Volstagg, Jeremy Renner (S.W.A.T., The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, 28 Weeks Later, The Hurt Locker, The Town) as Hawkeye; the S.H.I.E.L.D. sharpshooter, and Samuel L. Jackson (The Exorcist III, Jurassic Park, Jackie Brown, Shaft, Pulp Fiction, the Star Wars prequel trilogy, S.W.A.T., Snakes on a Plane, 1408,  Cleaner, The Spirit, Inglourious Basterds) as S.H.I.E.L.D. Director; General Nick Fury… And those are just the actors I already adore.

I’ve now also grown quite attached to Tom Hiddleston (Wallander) who plays Loki, Thor’s brother, and the main antagonist, as well as Joshua Dallas (Doctor Who and The Descent Part II) who plays another of the Warriors Three (above), and Kat Dennings (Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist and Defendor) who plays D’arcy Lewis; Jane Foster’s friend and colleague.

As I always like to say, I watched this film in a theatre (Belcompton, shit, uh, Belconnen, Hoyts to be specific). I really think this film has lasting value, but it’s important to note that I almost always feel a film is enhanced when watched on the big screen, especially with Action films, effects films, epic films and franchise films. Thor happens to be all of those things. I was especially excited waiting for the post-credits scene to come up in that huge cinema. So please take into consideration that I reviewed this on the silver screen, if you happen to be watching it on DVD or BluRay or some such. Because you better of not fucking downloaded it!!  Damn scum…

tmdb44006625,"I was surprised to see Kenneth Branagh directing a big budget comic book film, but as the film continued to explore a Shakespearean tale between two brothers feuding, the relationship with their father, and a coming of age love story, I realized this is exactly the kind of movie Kenneth Branagh would make.

I really enjoyed Thor. It was funny, exciting, and different from the usual superhero ilk. And it definitely got the MCU back on track after the dismal Iron Man 2."
Justin Lopez,"I haven't seen Chris Hemsworth act in any other film and this is the first time I've seen him in action, but I gotta say he really did justice to this role. Big thumbs up to Marvel for doing a great job on this casting!"
LoganWright,"Chris Hemsworth plays a great god of thunder! Much like how Downey has molded into his character, Iron Man, Chris has done the same thing too as Thor."
BradleyStewart,How Asgard was explained and how Thor came to be was explained really well. One of the better superhero origin stories for sure.
Jane Hall,"Not a big fan of the action sequences but story-wise, this film did great. It really explains how Thor came to be and why he is the person he is now."
JessieCollins,It's like Thor was actually made to fit Chris Hemsworth rather than the other way around! Marvel couldn't have done a better job at casting than this!
John Smith,One of the most original origin stories out there!
1RobertJohnson1,I didn't expect to like Thor as much as I did. Marvel sure knows their characters and they demonstrated that expertise by creating a superhero film that's a mix of Marvel comics and Norse mythology. Good job!
MichaelWilliams,Both Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston showed that they can be among the star players in the film industry worthy to be included in this movie.
WilliamJones,Tom Hiddleston is such a great actor! Chris is pretty great too but Tom has such a mesmerizing aura whenever you see him on-screen that it's hard not to  be absorbed by the film.
DavidBrown1,Both Loki and Thor make such a huge impression on screen. The two actors who portrayed these gods are surely top-tier!
JosephWilson,Impressive superhero film that goes well with the Iron Man solo movies that Marvel has released.
richardmiller,I loved how Chris Hemsworth did justice to the Norse God of Thunder. He is truly made for this role as much has Tom is made to be Loki.
ThomasMoore,"Great storytelling and depiction of how Asgard looks. Additionally, they did an awesome job in setting up Thor's family dynamics."
JeffreyYoung,Not a bad movie for the first film in a trilogy.
JacobKing1,I would give it a 7/10. A good superhero flick but I know they can do better than this.
NicholasLopez,There's a delicate balance between comic book fantasy and Norse mythology in this film and they were able to lay it all out perfectly.
StephenScott,It's immensely enjoyable and goes well with the Iron Man solo films.
r96sk,"Excellent.

<em>'Bolt'</em> is all a joy to watch. On paper, the premise can look a bit ridiculous, don't get me wrong it is, but the film manages to not only make it entertaining but to also make it both amusing and heartwarming.

The opening scenes are superbly done, when the cat (dog?) gets let out the bag, so to speak, it does take a few moments to regain its footing but quickly turns into a lot of fun. It's got a pleasing adventure, heartfelt feelings and comedy to keep it fresh.

The cast are very good, too. John Travolta (Bolt) and Miley Cyrus (Penny) do very fine jobs in their respective roles, but it's actually Susie Essman who stands out most to me - she gives a super performance as Mittens. A few of the other voices do solid stuff, also.

Thoroughly enjoyed this."
Andres Gomez,"This could have a pass based on the 3D but, in all honesty, the script and the story is totally senseless and unconnected. The travel through the Underworld maze to the Tartarus is just the best example of how bad the story is. In addition, they just mix the Greek mythology in the most absurd ways, putting a minotaur where it doesn't belong. 

Make up is quite bad. Specially with the beards and appearance of the gods.

Andromeda, who is also misplaced and doesn't really have any relevant role, is the spark to remark, played by Rosemund Pike."
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"The visual effects where very good. Unfortunately, that was about it. The script was just awful. I do not want to watch a movie about Greek mythology just to see the gods being portrayed as week, loosing their power and ultimately disappearing.

I don’t know why so many writers today cannot do anything better than to take a well known setting and then totally destroy it for thrills. It seems like they all have some “Lets-destroy-the-Enterprise” complex.

To me the awful script ruined this movie. It became depressing despite the good visual effects."
darrenhamilton14,"Let's leave it all at the door here. I loved Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, and Batman. Hated Batman Returns, Alice in Wonderland, and Willy Wonka. Could care less about Nightmare before Christmas and Sweeney Todd. Okay, so I'm not a Tim Burton hater. I'm not a huge Tim Burton fan. I think in this situation, I'm as close as you get to the average movie goer. No agenda, no attachments. That being said, this film is terrible. Burton spent so much effort and time worrying about making this film Gothic and off pace, stuffing his favorite actors into the film even though half of their parts were pointless, he forgot he was making a film. It's a simple and fun idea but it feels like ego and ""showiness"" kept them from making the plot even make sense. We get it Tim! You are weird! Don't ruin a good performance by Depp and a fun idea for a film because you have to live up to your own Gothic standards. Grow up. So much talent is wasted on these films having the same look, cast, and feel to them. Take that talent and make something fresh! Stretch yourself just a tad out of that Hot Topic comfort zone will ya? This movie was long, boring, and ruined. All of the funny scenes were in the trailer. By the way.... wasn't this supposed to be the 70's? Other than a shot or two of trees and a hippie van it was just like the set of Sweeney Todd. The whole film felt like London in the 40's. That's bad film making whether your name is Tim Burton or not."
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"I generally like Tim Burton as well as  Johnny Depp. This movie was no exception. It is a dark (of course with Tim Burton) comedy with some hint of action/thriller in it. I would not really characterize it as a horror movie even though there are a vampire as well as a witch and a werewolf in it. Of course there is the romance stuff but I personally feel that is really more of a background or justification to the plot than anything else.

This is not a magnificent movie but it’s a good movie. I have never seen the original series so I am not biased by that. It seems that many people that considers this to be a bad movie refers to the original show. I have read several of the critical reviews and I do not agree with most of them.

I found this movie to be a nice, moderately paced, comedy in a vampire/gothic setting. The mood and the wackiness were fairly typical for a Tim Burton production. Johnny Depp was pretty much as can be expected which is a good thing if you like Johnny Depp. 
The return of Barnabas to his, now rather dysfunctional, family is rather funny. The ease with how Barnabas was duped and trapped again in the second half of the film was a bit annoying but then, he had been asleep for a few centuries.

The entire family quite enjoyed this movie."
Wuchak,"***I don’t get all the hate***

On coastal Maine, a Vampire named Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is released in 1972 after almost 200 years in captivity and reacquaints himself with his family’s chateau & the nearby fishing village. Michelle Pfeiffer plays the Collins matriarch, Helena Bonham Carter the in-house shrink, Eva Green a conniving witch, Bella Heathcote the reincarnation of Barnabas’ long-lost love and Chloë Grace Moretz a 15 year-old punk.

Directed by Tim Burton, “Dark Shadows” (2012) isn’t far removed in tone from his “Sleepy Hollow” (1999), which also featured Depp as the protagonist, although I suppose “Shadows” throws in a little more humor. I’ve never seen the TV soap opera Dark Shadows or the subsequent two movies, so I can’t compare this movie to them. All I know is that I liked this rendition quite a bit, just as I liked the inexplicably reviled “The Lone Ranger” (2013).

The October/November ambiance (i.e. Halloween-season) is to die for and Depp as Barnabas Collins maintains your interest throughout. He’s obviously a fish-out-of-water in 1972, but acclimates pretty quickly. Eva Green is perfect as the ee-vil witch and Carter is enjoyable as usual. I don’t get the hubbub over Moretz, but she’s a’right (and holds a surprise for the last act). Alice Cooper is featured in a glorified cameo. I should add that the opening credits sequence with “Nights in White Satin” is cinema at its finest.

The movie runs 1 hour, 53 minutes and was shot in England (Devon, Buckinghamshire, Kent, Cornwall &  Farnham) and Scotland (Mull, Argyll and Bute) with exteriors of the chateau shot at Trafalgar Castle School, Whitby, Ontario, Canada.

GRADE: B"
Gimly,"I'm sorry but I am incapable of buying 50-year-old Johnny Depp as the immortal, youthful, irresistible heir to his father's New World empire. Maybe in a better movie, I would have been too distracted to be bothered by it, but this is Tim Burton's 2012 reboot of _Dark Shadows_, so that was not the case. 

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
Kamurai,"Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

Don't get me wrong, this is probably a stranger than good watch, but from concept to story to characters, it has a lot of good to it.  Some of the choices are a bit odd, but they do create their own problem-solution story arcs that make it feel like this was a comic book that was consolidated into a movie.

While Depp's typical weirdness is abundant, each character has their own weirdness about them, and the otherworldly atmosphere of the movie is what makes it.

Eva Green does steals the show whenever she makes an appearance, and her character is a force of power, and it shows.

There is something very intriguing about immortal characters locked in battle, and that's what really draws me back to this movie."
leros,good!
Frank Ochieng,"Some over-stuffed blockbuster actioners boldly boast their explosive and invigorating productions with dynamic glee. Well, the ‘Mission: Impossible’ film franchise echoes this same sentiment, with flashy fifty-something star Tom Cruise still carrying that boyish exuberance that never seems to miss a beat, and can breathe a sigh of relief because the latest chapter will not disappoint in its adventurous, adrenaline-rushing skin. Yes, Cruise is back as IMF super spy stud Ethan Hunt in writer-director Christopher McQuarrie’s power-surging ‘Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation’. Notoriously slick, ambitious, wildly impish and vastly intriguing, ‘Rogue Nation’ incorporates superb direction, writing and, of course, its no-nonsense dosage of non-stop shenanigans to fuel the audience’s escapist palates.

In actuality, ‘Rogue Nation’ is a hyper and hip throwback to the original blueprint for this kinetic movie series that took viewers by storm when it first premiered back in 1996. The minor outcry for the box office sensation that was the ‘Mission: Impossible’ big screen offering back in the late 90s was quite understandable since it did not seem to stay entirely true to the iconic 60s television series thus being dismissed as a volt-driven vanity piece for the high-strutting Cruise. Still, the cinematic ‘Mission: Impossible’ experience did not peter out but steadily built a devoted fan base that wanted to endure the high-flying hedonism of Cruise’s espionage daredevil Hunt and his band of cunning cohorts. It is definitely safe to say that the stellar ‘Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation’ has delivered a bang for its buck in a summertime cinema hunger that thrives for such sleek, innovative spy thrillers that charm more than harm. Maybe ‘Rogue Nation’ will not let anyone forget the exploits of the legendary James Bond spy capers anytime soon but hey…Cruise’s hotshot Hunt has a colorfully distinctive way of promoting his ‘shaken, not stirred’ moments as well.

So how did the collaboration of filmmaker McQuarrie and his chance-taking lead Cruise give ‘Rogue Nation’ its deliciously sinister, overactive pulse? The fact that the overzealous stuntwork (much of it performed by Cruise with daring enthusiasm) is imaginative and the story feels smart and clever certainly has a lot to do with the magnetic appeal of ‘Rogue Nation’. Hey, the TV advertisements even give a generous peek into the pulsating platitudes that the MI universe will swallow with robust anticipation. Watch IMF agent Hunt hang on to a speedy airplane with his dear life in the balance. Watch IMF agent Hunt jump into a deadly spiral of a waterfall. Watch IMF agent Hunt race a piercingly fast motorcycle (or car…take your pick) and enjoy the road raging carnage with poetic prominence. Okay…you get the picture.

The premise in ‘Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation’ has more bounce to it than a basketball during the NBA playoffs and that is not necessarily a bad thing to note. While Hunt continues his mission to stop the team’s latest despicable foe (Sean Harris) and end the operation of the insidious operation known as the Syndicate there are feathers being ruffled because of the federalised threats to shut down the IMF empire through the suggestion of a top-notch CIA director (Alec Baldwin). Naturally, IMF head honcho Brandt (Jeremy Renner) tries to prevent such hasty actions as his team of agents must overcome some of the controversy and confrontations from previous disastrous events that have warranted the threatening hints to shutdown his governmental outfit.

Cruise's Agent Ethan Hunt is leaving on a jet plane and doesn't know how long he'll be back again in the eye-popping actioner MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE-ROGUE NATION.
Cruise’s Agent Ethan Hunt is leaving on a jet plane and doesn’t know how long he’ll be back again in the eye-popping actioner MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE-ROGUE NATION.
One cannot say enough about the ponderous yet action-packed ‘Rogue Nation’ as this exceedingly spry and hyperactive spy caper keeps one on their anxious feet while never letting up for a gasp of air. The exotic locales, showy opera houses, heart-pounding action sequences, innovative chase scenes on wheels, over-the-top baddies, well-choreographed fist fights and, of course, Cruise’s roguish Hunt and his willingness to soak up the mischievousness and mayhem of the proceedings allows this particular ‘Mission: Impossible’ installment to resonate so soundly in its off-kilter, energetic greatness. The supporting players such as Simon Pegg’s Benji and Ving Rhames’s Luther are on hand to contribute to the landscape of the triumphant cloak-and-dagger goings-on. In particular, Rebecca Ferguson is the transfixing tart whose presence as Cruise’s enigmatic female lead is easily a scene stealer. Can she be trusted or not? Who cares? In the long run, Ferguson’s inclusion is almost mandatory just to spice up this first-rate popcorn pleaser a tad bit more. Tom Hollander (‘In the Loop’) adds some flavor in the mix as the unpredictable British Prime Minister.

McQuarrie (who worked with Cruise previously on ‘Jack Reacher’ and helmed ‘The Way Of The Gun’) had a tough act to follow in terms of trying to keep stride with prior ‘Mission: Impossible’ big names in auteurs Brian De Palma, John Woo, J.J. Abrams and Brad Bird. Indeed, that is a tall order to fill. However, as the Oscar-winner screenwriter for ‘The Usual Suspects’ McQuarrie has shown that his take on the fifth edition of the ‘Mission: Impossible’ film franchise with ‘Rogue Nation’ can easily be as defiant and defining as any of his predecessors’ intense, eye-popping outings.

‘Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation’, with its lavish set pieces and sophisticated sense of winding and grinding with the twitchy antics of Cruise leading the pack, is perhaps the closest thing to resembling the elegance and excellence of the indomitable Agent 007.

Andres Gomez,"Everything you can expect from a ""Mission: Impossible"" movie. The script is not the brightest nor the freshest but works OK. Cruise, Pegg and Rhames keep the franchise afloat while Renner and Baldwin feel unneeded.

Great addition with Ferguson. She takes most of the attention in this movie.

Good work from the direction."
Gimly,"So after all that, I’m pretty convinced that the _Mission: Impossible_ series just isn’t for me. That being said, how many film franchises can say that their fifth instalment was also their best? Probably just this one, and, maybe _Fast & Furious_. There’s actually a lot of parallels between those two lines of movies. 

Pertaining specifically to _Mission: Impossible_ though, this one truly is the best of the bunch in my opinion. It has it’s most complete female role to date, in fact, you could say that of any character. This is the first film that doesn’t feel like it entirely hinges on Ethan Hunt’s input. The characters surrounding him are actual people with their own personalities and ideas. And maybe it’s just that I’ve watched him do it five times in the past three days, but honestly I even sort of bought Tom Cruise in an action role this time around. 

Crazy.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
John Chard,"Extended Cut: Proving in fact that The Wolfman is no monstrosity.

The Wolfman is directed by Joe Johnston and adapted to screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self from Curt Siodmak's original 1941 screenplay. It stars Benicio del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt and Hugo Weaving. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and Shelly Johnson is the cinematographer. Plot is set in 1891 and finds Toro as Lawrence Talbot, who upon learning of his brother's grizzly murder, returns to his estranged father's estate in Blackmoor to investigate. Upon arriving he forms an instant bond with his dead sibling's fiancée, Gwen (Blunt), but soon Lawrence finds himself mired in a world of lycanthropy and family secrets.

It had a much publicised troubled production, with a director switch, numerous release date changes and enforced cuts to the running time, sitting atop of this particular iceberg. With that it mind, film is arguably better than it had any right to be. What is now readily available is an extended cut of the film where some 17 minutes of footage have been put back into the story. Footage cut originally to foolishly speed up the moment when the first transformation from man to wolfman arrives. Is the extended cut a far better movie than the trimmed theatrical version? The answer is resounding yes it is. It still contains flaws, but now the narrative is stronger and crucially by waiting much longer for the first ""big change scene"", tension and anticipation now exist where previously it didn't. 

In spite of some modern day advancements for this 21st Century wolfman - 
excessive speed for the wolf - creature smack down finale - Johnston's movie is very faithful and respectful of the 1941 original. Which is perhaps not surprising since the weight of Universal is backing this remake of one of their original classic monsters from the 30's and 40's. But it's nice to see that a remake keeps the things that made the original so beloved. Gothic texture is rich, none more so than with the mist/smog shrouded village, while the tortured sadness that permeated Lon Chaney's take on Larry Talbot back in 1941, is perfectly essayed by del Toro this time around. 

The creature design itself cleaves close to the original, with Rick Baker and Dave Elsey picking up the Academy Award for Best Makeup for their excellent efforts. Fans of shred and gore are also well served here, with Johnston (The Rocketeer/Jumanji) showing a keen eye for action construction. An attack at a Gypsy camp and a bloody rampage through a bus are the stand outs, while an asylum sequence is also not to be sniffed at. Chuck in the murder mystery element, and the intriguing father and son axis, and it's a film that has more to it than merely being a CGI popcorn piece. Even Elfman's score fits neatly into the period setting. 

Problem wise it comes down to Blunt and Weaving being under used, and Hopkins veering dangerously close to over hamming the omelette, yet all remain strong in characterisations. Toro, though, is not, as some have suggested, miscast. Already lupine like before transformation, he plays it perfectly troubled and brooding like. Talbot has inner demons and unanswered questions in his past, a past he has tried to shred but finds he now must confront those demons. The onset of lycanthropy serving, one feels, as a metaphor for his personal torment finally being unleashed. Toro nails it with an excellent and subdued portrayal, even if the choice of hair style leaves much to be desired. Worth a mention as well is Shelly Johnson's photography, where nice atmospheric visuals complement the tone and period flavour of the piece. 

More homage than outright horror, but with a little something for everyone interested in Horror/Gothic/Mystery type movies, The Wolfman in extended form is an enjoyable enough experience. 7/10"
Wuchak,"***A hilarious bee movie***  

Released in 2007, ""Bee Movie"" is an animated movie about a bee, Barry B. Benson (voiced by Jerry Seinfeld), a fresh college graduate who becomes disillusioned by his limited career choices in the hive. Upon taking a special trip to the outside world his life is saved by Vanessa (Renée Zellweger), a beautiful florist in New York City. As their relationship develops, he discovers humans actually harvest honey by enslaving bees; and understandably decides to sue humanity, but this has repercussions.

I'm not big on animated flicks, but this one has frequent laugh-out-loud moments, particularly the first half. But you have to pay attention to the rapid fire dialogue and the details in the frame or you'll miss out on half the laughs. Consider for, for example, the ATFH officer (What's the 'H'stand for?). The second half remains compelling, but is more low-key in amusement. Bottom line: ""Bee Movie"" is one of my all-time favorite comedies. By the way, I know Vanessa's animated, but she's actually HOT.

ADDITIONAL VOICES are supplied by the likes of Matthew Broderick, Patrick Warburton, John Goodman, Chris Rock, Kathy Bates, Barry Levinson, Larry King, Ray Liotta, Sting, Oprah Winfrey and Rip Torn.

The film runs 91 minutes.

GRADE: A"
Andres Gomez,"Threre are few sequels that are better than the original. This is one of them.

Smarter, with good plot and an amazing animation. Perfect for a movie session with the family."
Sheldon Nylander,"Admittedly, I wasn’t the biggest fan of the first “Kung Fu Panda.” Don’t get me wrong, it’s alright, but that’s all. Just alright. The jokes about him being big and clumsy get old after an hour and a half, to the point where it almost seems like a movie that’s trying to (ironically) fat shame kids.

“Kung Fu Panda 2” is really more of the same. Same characters, same plot, same jokes. It’s extremely predictable with literally no surprises, giving the characters little depth. What we are presented with here is essentially a paint-by-numbers family film. If you’re okay with that, then more power to you. It’s pretty harmless brain candy, but if you’re looking for more substance or any way to challenge your kids a little, look elsewhere. Again, it’s just kind of...there. Ironically zen, in a way."
The Movie Diorama,"Kung Fu Panda 2 excitedly kicks, punches and belly flops its way through overused visual humour. “Everybody was kung fu fighting!” much more so in this sequel when compared to its predecessor. The Furious Five were slapping Shen’s army of diabolical wolves left, right and centre. Master Shifu prodding his stick conveniently during the climactic battle. And a plethora of other anthropomorphic beasts harnessing the power of said martial art. This very much felt like an animated martial arts feature, one aspect the original was sorely missing. However, despite DreamWorks’ best efforts in continuing Po’s search in becoming the Dragon Warrior, its quality offers no improvements. Unable to surpass the boundaries of family-friendly humour that reduces the visual splendour and narrative heft to progress the story onto the next level.

Po, having realised who his parents truly are (not a goose...), must save China with the Furious Five from the malicious peacock Shen and his fascination with metallic weapons. DreamWorks constantly pump out family orientated animations with powerful morals every year. This sequel illustrating the ability to manipulate our past childhoods to shape the person we want to be. For Po, this meant ignoring the familial scars that Shen caused, producing his prepubescent abandonment. A notable moral that many should abide by, but unfortunately is weighed down by excessive comedy that diminished a vast amount of beautiful moments. Aside from the tantalising scene when Po finally discovered what happened to his parents, conveyed through mesmerising hand-drawn animated flashbacks, all other heartfelt examples were brutalised by Po’s apparent requirement to exercise his bumbling personality. Black’s prolific voice doesn’t help matters, with a lack of sincerity to his vocal performance, but the frantic pacing and rushed sequences made for a frustrating central narrative.

That’s not to say this sequel is poor, in fact it’s just as consistent as its predecessor. Rather infuriating is all given the tender bamboo seeds that were lovingly planted, unable to grow into ferocious stalks. The humour, as overwhelming as it is, does provide characterisation to these animals. Po in particular. Making it hugely accessible for all members of all families to watch and enjoy.

The action sequences were splendid and vibrantly colourful, with some ingenious editing that made one chase scene resemble ‘Pac-Man’. The oriental aesthetics and environments built a beautifully inclusive world for the characters to roam in. The antagonist, Shen, was far more memorable and sinister in comparison to...ummm...I forgot his name. The snow leopard? We’ll go with that. Mostly due to Oldman’s vocal work that has a larger range than the entirety of his filmography (and that’s saying something!). The red and black lighting was, at times, excessive in depicting “evil” and surprisingly dark. No, not thematically. It was literally difficult to see anything!

Aside from that, Kung Fu Panda 2 slaps. And punches. And kicks. But also tumbles repetitively due to Po’s constant buffoonery. It does however set the third film up nicely, so guess I’ll have to give that a go..."
Sword0fTheSpirit,"Lots of people complain about this movie not holding true to the original animated version. For those of us with eyes unclouded by bias, this is an excellent movie. I hope the fans have not ruined the chance for the sequels to be produced... I hate an unfinished series, and this one has real potential."
Gimly,"I would say it is the strongest entry of the first three Mission: Impossible films (the only ones I've seen to date). Even a decade later, it's strengths are still that which the franchise has always been known for, and its weakness are much the same. Much more akin plot-wise to the first film, _M:I:III_ has the one advantage over its predecessors that it's villain is much stronger than any we have seen before. Though arguably not the primary antagonist, Seymour-Hoffman (RIP) is actually pretty terrifying as international arms dealer, Owen Davian.

That said, while this third entry is certainly the most engaging thus far, it still had me checking my watch before the end of the movie, so I can hardly give it a glowing review.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
CinemaSerf,"Despite the introduction of the always annoying Simon Pegg, this is an huge improvement on the last instalment. It sees the now retired, loved-up ""Ethan"" (Tom Cruise) coaxed out of retirement to deal with the menacing arms dealer ""Davian"" (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who has just bumped off one of the IMF's finest as he tries to offload the devilishly toxic ""rabbit's foot"" - a weapon with devastating potential. The initial part of the operation goes smoothly enough, but when his prey escapes his clutches, ""Ethan"" soon realises that he is going to be used to obtain the weapon - else his girlfriend ""Julia"" (Michelle Monaghan) is going to be toast. PSH is a super baddie here, very much in the less is more school of menace, but not afraid to get a bit brutal when called for. The story itself is all pretty routine, there isn't much jeopardy throughout, but the action scenes are more natural and less choreographed than last time out, and PSH also does add quite a lot of extra gravitas to the proceedings. It also features one of the more assured performance from the usually wooden as a tree Jonathan Rhys Meyers with Ving Rhames having a more substantial, and quite entertaining, role too. I'm not sure what anyone can really do about the inevitability of the conclusion - we just know these films are going to keep on coming, but this one from the established writing team of Kurtzman and Orci keeps moving well with plenty of gadgets, body morphing and action to pass the two hour mark comfortably."
mooney240,"**Mission: Impossible 3 gives the franchise something more than explosions and cool gadgets. It gives the series heart and family.**

Mission: Impossible 3 carried the heavy burden of trying to ground the fantastical world of Mission Impossible with its insane stunts and extraordinary gadgets after the franchise took it all a little too far in MI2. JJ Abrams took the reins, simplified the plot to Ethan Hunt’s struggle to rescue his fiancée, and filled the cast with excellent talents like Michelle Monaghan, Phillip Seymore Hoffman, Keri Russell, Simon Pegg, and more. While the stunts and gadgets that define the franchise were still in the film, they were not the focus. Instead, MI3 concentrated on developing Hunt’s character and his struggle to protect his loved ones from his work. This movie frequently finds itself at the bottom of the Mission: Impossible rankings, but I think it’s one of the best in the series and gave the franchise the heart and direction it needed to become the box office behemoth it is today."
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"I have to say, or in this case write, that this was a fairly disappointing movie. It is pretty much a Die Hard wannabee with a daughter-dislikes-father sub-plot. I do not mind the reusing of the Die Hard concept if the film is good. This one is not really. The script is a stupid, unintelligent political script.

It starts off badly with some nonsensical crap about a controversial (that is putting it mildly) political deal with the Middle East about pulling out troops from all the bases in the Middle East. To add to this the entire situation have come about because the president just left several people to hang out and dry when he decided to pull the plug on operations in the Middle East. By hanging out and dry we mean get killed or spend some quality time in the regional prisons. That put the president on the bad guy list instead of the good guy as far as I am concerned. I do not know if the writer was trying to make a political statement, which I never like in my movies, or is just plain stupid. Given the rest of the script I would go for stupid or both.

The good thing with the movie is that there is quite a lot of action and some of it is rather okay to watch. There are a few funny moments as well. I quite liked the tour guide for example.

Unfortunately, even if you try to forget about the political nonsense, the rest of the script is just full of utter stupidity. It starts of not too bad with the diversion at the Capitol and the initial take over of the White House even though a whole bunch of armed, obviously unscreened, guys getting into the White House to work on the president’s home theatre like that is not very believable.

After that it gradually degrades though. Cale is nowhere as charismatic, nor as professional, as McClane and there are lots of silly and stupid moments. For example, the car chase starts of not too bad but then Cale get’s into some bloody dream mode and gets shot up. Just dumb. During the same episode the tank scene is just ridiculous. Would they only have one tank? Not very likely. It takes forever for it to move. It is also highly improbable that it could be taken out like that by a hand-held launcher by a front hit. Rear or side maybe but not a front hit. The writer is obviously clueless about military matters. The fumbled chopper attack is embarrassingly bad. The worst is probably when Cale’s daughter stops and air-strike by waving a flag outside the White House. I almost turned off the movie at that point.

It is too bad because the movie had the budget and some nice actors to be a good action movie but was just ruined by a louse script with a totally unnecessary bunch of political nonsense in it. The next time I see a movie were the script is written by James Vanderbilt I am going to be very cautious."
r96sk,"I genuinely enjoyed <em>'Mars Needs Moms'</em>.

I like the story it portrays, sure it's nothing extraordinarily great or anything but I feel it hits the intended spots due to the hearty narrative with the main character and his mother. I'd argue the voice cast do good work, principally Dan Fogler as Gribble. Seth Green/Seth Dusky (Milo), Elisabeth Harnois (Ki) and Joan Cusack (Mom) are all fine too.

The sci-fi parts are undercooked certainly, but I feel what's there works well enough for Milo's side of the story. The end few scenes are meaningful, I did care for the characters what can I say. Animation-wise I liked it as well, especially for the humans. It does look a tad weird, granted.

Personally, I rate it."
Frank Ochieng,"As likened to an innocuous fairy tale rash, the movie mythology surrounding J.M. Barrie’s classical kiddie character “Peter Pan” comes and goes when it pleases. Naturally there have been several big screen interpretations to outlast one’s reserved stash of pixie dust to fling around. From perhaps the best known animated film adaptation of Walt Disney’s nostalgically revered version to the surprisingly big-budgeted Steven Spielberg-directed spectacle dud Hook with a high-caliber cast the legend of “The Boy That Never Grew Up” seems to spark the challenge of presenting yet another spin on Barrie’s iconic treasured tyke.

In director Joe Wright’s sci-fi fantasy action-adventure Pan the familiar factors of Barrie’s magical Boy Wonder are evident and should serve as a mild and manufactured revisit to the “Peter Pan” folklore for children of all ages. However, the whimsical aspect of Pan was dubiously overshadowed, overproduced yet curiously understated in its ability to convey a storytelling moment that did not seem laborious. Consequently, Pan feels mechanical and never quite settles in with any sense of breezy charm or youthful balance of wonderment. Instead, the audience is left wondering about the uniqueness and distinctive approach to an already ubiquitous serving of Barrie’s celebrated literary lad. Despite the vibrant visuals and the given big screen blueprint for “Peter Pan’s” endearing legacy Wright’s toothless tale of flashy action and adventure may just prove to be another proverbial flash in the Pan. 

Clearly, there is no rhyme or rhythm to tamper with the built-in concept of what the majestic make-up for “Peter Pan” should be conceived in the minds of generations that were subjected to Barrie’s boundless boy. Still, Wright and Jason Fuchs fail to capture any fresh imagination or intrigue about the puppy dog-eyed youngster’s on-screen by-the-dots adventures. This pumped-up project is pedestrian at best and nothing more than another sparkled rung in the “Peter Pan” ladder of box office hits-and-misses. The casting for Pan is decent enough but the shoddy material they are left to elevate with their included presence is wasted in a stillborn fantasy odyssey that cannot overcome its own creative indifference.

Pan seeks to start out with its own embedded twist by delivering this narrative as a prequel set in 1940’s London. Here, we are introduced to 12-year old Peter (Levi Miller) whose disillusionment continues to spiral while staying at the chaotic Catholic orphanage he was unceremoniously dumped off courtesy of his desperate mother (Amanda Seyfried). Nevertheless, Peter maintains some semblance of hope that his mother will soon return to fetch him and all should solve whatever abandonment issues he has at hand.

Soon, Peter and his fellow orphanage buddies will succumb to the clutches of Blackbeard the Pirate (Hugh Jackman). Evidently bad boy Blackbeard had been a notorious busy beaver by sadistically kidnapping working class children and shipping them off to his Neverland mines to toil there. However, Blackbeard and his bunch cannot be too bad to tolerate since they welcome out-of-the-blue snappy sing-a-longs to such noteworthy tunes as Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit” and the Romones’ “Biltzkrieg Bop”. Huh? Of course this impromptu musical sequence is not the only thing that seems curiously out of place in the disjointed Pan. 

Okay...so Hugh Jackman has both a black beard and a black heart in PAN. How about a blackboard to erase this ill-conceived ode to the J.M. Barrie treasured tyke?
Okay…so Hugh Jackman has both a black beard and a black heart in PAN. How about a blackboard to erase this ill-conceived ode to the J.M. Barrie treasured tyke?
It is not long before the plagued Peter meets and becomes attached to a hustling drifter named James Hook (Garrett Hedlund). Yes folks…it appears that Star Wars comparisons are in order here as Peter’s Luke Skywalker teams with shifty Hook’s Han Solo to defeat the devilish Blackbeard’s Darth Vader. And you might want to ask who is the Princess Leia in this disguised Star Wars premise amid the mines and high seas? Well, in this case Princess Leia is in the form of Pan’s Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara). Thus, the gang assembles together in an attempt to thwart the iron fist of Darth Vader…er, the diabolical Blackbeard. The excitable exploits of the crew coming together to defeat the pesky pirate is meshed together with the flashy flourishes of random 3-D special effects, the vitality of color and scope and playful variations of well-known “Peter Pan” personalities. Hence, all the festive and feisty flexing that Pan demonstrates still cannot compensate for a lackluster execution of Wright’s anemic installment that botches a ready-made backstory for “Peter Pan” enthusiasts.

As Peter, Miller shows some solid and impish promise as the boy searching for self-discovery in a bizarre surrounding of despair and disappointment. Jackman’s over-the-top villainous Blackbeard is simply passable but nothing really worth hanging your hat on. Jackman’s plotting pirate will not make anyone dismiss Johnny Depp’s Captain Jack Sparrow from the Pirates of the Caribbean movies anytime soon. The added elements in supporting players such as Hedlund’s Hook and Mara’s Tiger Lily (not to mention the Lost Boys) feel synthetic and arbitrary–something not very encouraging as these characterizations are essential to the whole “Peter Pan” universe.

Unfortunately for Pan one might end up saying never mind to the boisterous yet aimless shenanigans situated in Neverland.

Reno,"> Its when Peter stepped into the Neverland for the first time.

Usually everyone loved growing up watching the various film adaptations of original work by JM Barrie's a century old creation, 'Peter Pan'. There are plenty of unofficial prequels and sequels were also made and met success. Yet this prequel with high budget and modern technology, but not a Disney film, generated some expectations with stars like Hugh Jackman and Rooney Mara in it.

The box office was not as expected, and the movie was also just above average, but I liked the performances and visuals. The story is about an orphan Peter who becomes a Pan, a leader to 'the lost boys'. The opening line goes like this: 'Sometimes friends begin as enemies and enemies as friends' and that's what the rest of the movie evolves.

I don't think I liked this story. In all the prequels, I loved the Nick Willing's 'Neverland' who is a master of prequels to all the greatest fairytales. I disappointed with this only because of lack of the depth in narration, short storyline and quick scenes, other than that it was not a bad flick to me. The main relief was, it was not like the recent 'Alice in Wonderland' style movie with the weird costumes, makeups and the character physiques.

Despite all the negative feedback for this flick, I feel it won't hurt for a one time watch. My eye is now on its sequel, because before the Wendy's introduction there's another story is to be told and that is between Peter and Hook. But now it's on doubt over the result of this movie. Anyway, I'm on for it and hope it only gets better than the original.

Per Gunnar Jonsson,"I found this to be a quite enjoyable family movie derived from the Peter Pan story we all love. I am not really sure why it holds a fairly mediocre rating on most rating sites. It is undeserved as far as I am concerned.

The movie is a prequel which tells the story of how Peter became Peter Pan. I think the story is fairly well done and allows for both adventure and humor.

The characters are pretty good although I found Peter Pan to actually be the weakest of them. Hook and Tiger Lily not to mention Blackbeard stole quite a lot of my attention. Peter Pan is not bad just a little…bland.

The movie is darker and more real than other Peter Pan movies. Blackbeard is a rather nasty villain and there are certainly more danger for the good guys in this movie. People do not just get nocked down and come back, they really die.

The special effects are not bad. I quite liked the pixie swarms at the end of the movie. Also, unlike what some reviewers state Peter Pan does fly in the movie. I can only assume that those who state that he does not never bothered to see the movie to the end. Do not review a movie if you cannot be bothered to finish it for Christ sake!

The movie leaves a bit of a whole between the end of this story and the beginning of the traditional Peter Pan story. What happened to make Peter and Hook become enemies and what is the story between Hook and the crocodile for instance? I certainly would not mind a second movie about that."
John,"I'm not a big fan of the loser-hero, boy-centric themes in this one, however the animation and sound is high quality and worth the watch."
Wuchak,"***""Where does it end?"" -- ""It never ends.""***

If Homer's mythical epic ""The Iliad"" is based on a factual story, that story is magnificently depicted in Wolfgang Petersen's 2004 epic ""Troy."" In other words, don't expect any goofy 'gods' or 'goddesses' like Athena popping out of thin air because ""Troy"" is a realistic portrayal of the Trojan war.

More than that, ""Troy"" is arguably the best sword & sandal epic ever put to film. You name the picture -- ""Samson and Delilah,"" ""Spartacus,"" ""Ben-Hur,"" ""Ulysses,"" ""The Viking Queen,"" “Conan the Barbarian,” ""Braveheart,"" ""Attila,"" ""The Odyssey,"" ""Gladiator,"" etc. -- ""Troy"" is superior. At the very least it’s as good as some of the better flicks just noted, like ""Ben-Hur,"" and far edges out ""Spartacus"" and ""Samson and Delilah."" As for more recent sword & sandal epics, like the overrated ""Braveheart"" or ""Gladiator,"" ""Troy"" blows 'em out of the water. 

Roger Ebert is a great writer and critic, but his mediocre review of ""Troy"" is all wrong. Ebert's major criticisms, believe it or not, are the main reasons I have such high respect for this film: He complains that Petersen omitted the many Greek 'gods' & 'goddesses' and gripes that the actors perform their roles as believable people and not larger-than-life caricatures. This can, of course, be respectably done, as in the 1955 film ""Ulysses,"" but this is not what Petersen was shooting for in ""Troy."" His goal, as already noted, was to depict the actual Trojan War on which Homer's myth is based. (Even if it never really took place, wars LIKE IT did).

Regarding Brad Pitt's heavily criticized performance as Achilles, I couldn’t care less about Pitt until seeing this movie as he does an outstanding job portraying Greece's greatest warrior. No, he's not the bulkiest warrior to ever grace the earth, but he's fast as lightning, confident, expertly skilled and deadly accurate. Even his voice completely fits the role. Eric Bana (from ""Hulk"") is also great as Hector, Achilles' Trojan counterpart, who's sick of war and just wants to live a life of peace with his family. These two have a showdown in the film and it is without a doubt the greatest mano-a-mano sword & sandal duel ever filmed.

What's interesting about the picture is that you never really end up rooting for one side or the other. When Achilles and Hector have their powerful face-off, my wife and I couldn't decide for whom to root. Maybe that's the point. Don't get me wrong, Agamemnon could be viewed as the villain in this picture, and I wasn't rooting for Menelaus when he fights Paris (Orlando Bloom, who seduces Helen, Menelaus' wife), but neither the Greeks nor the Trojans are painted as the 'good guys' or 'bad guys.' They're just people at war, and in war there's no real glory, as Hector points out... and it never ends, as Achilles states. An additional point is that living in a state of war is a JOYLESS existence. And both Bana and Pitt get this across well.

As for beautiful women, there are only a couple mentionable: Diane Kruger plays Helen, ""the face that launched a thousand ships."" Some have complained that she's too plain for the role, but I disagree. I’m not a fan of hers or anything, but she looks pretty dang sharp to me (not to mention has an impressive behind shot). Besides, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. If Paris deems her worthy of starting a war, who are we to disagree? Also on hand is cutie Rose Byrne who plays Briseis, the virgin priestess whom Achilles converts to the pleasures of the flesh.

I should point out that ""Troy"" was one of the most expensive pictures ever made at the time and it definitely SHOWS on the screen. Make no mistake, ""Troy"" is breath-taking just to WATCH -- the colossal armies, ships and battles are awe-inspiring to behold, not to mention the Maltan and Mexican locations. And the CGI effects are outstanding for the time, not fake-looking like the Rome & Coliseum scenes in ""Gladiator."" 

Another complaint by Ebert is that the dialogue is lousy; nothing could be further from the truth. There are great pieces of dialogue interspersed throughout, including Achilles' comment that the 'gods' envy people because we're mortal and ""Everything's beautiful because we're doomed."" Thankfully, there's not one goofy one-liner anywhere to be found.

James Horner's score should also be mentioned. If you enjoyed the soundtrack of ""The Passion of the Christ"" you'll love this one because it's just as good/serious/reverent/powerful. For instance, the intense percussion during Achilles and Hector's showdown is magnificent.

Interestingly, Brad Pitt, who plays Achilles, injured his Achilles tendon during shooting. Fitting, no? 

FINAL WORD: If you're in the mood for a sword & sandal epic, ""Troy"" more than fills the bill. The story captivates from the get-to and never lets up the entire 2.5 hour runtime (technically 2 hours, 42 minutes, with credits). It extravagantly visualizes the Trojan War for you, something I never did until seeing this mind-blowing, outstanding piece of cinema.

GRADE: A+"
John Chard,"It's yours, take it. 

Trojan prince Paris is not only having an affair with Spartan Menelaus' woman, Helen. He also lures her away to live with him in Troy. Thus giving the global domination obsessed King Agamenon the launch pad to war with Troy. Which in turn brings into conflict Spartan hero Achilles and Hector of Troy, two of the greatest warriors that ever lived.

Troy, budgeted at $175 million, and given to director Wolfgang Petersen with orders to craft a swordplay epic based on Homer's Illiad, is not the truly great picture it really should have been. It is, however, a spectacle of sorts, that by way of the extended directors cut, becomes a fine enough addition to the genre it so clearly wanted to crown.

The problems are evident from the off. The casting of Brad Pitt as Achilles always looked to have been based purely on looks. Nicely toned body and brooding close ups do not a warrior make, and thus, as good an actor as Pitt definitely is, this is a role (and genre) too far. Diane Kruger as Helen is under written, which since at the time was a poor actress yet to bloom turns out to be a bonus here, and Orlando Bloom playing the wimp like Lothario Paris the way he should do - still gets out acted and swamped by all around him. The other main problem is how uneven the story telling is. Petersen looks confused as how to condense the Trojan war in the running time, whilst also juggling the emphasis of the two great warriors at its core. That Eric Bana's excellent portrayal of Hector comes through the jumble is a testament to Bana's ability and nothing else.

The good is, well, rather good though. Agamemnon, courtesy of a nasty turn from Brian Cox, is well formed. It gives the picture a reason for being outside of it being a war about some bloke stealing a woman from another bloke. Imperial cravings and a genuine thirst for blood helps lift Troy out of the rocky waters it had found itself in. Peter O'Toole, Brendan Gleeson and Sean Bean do fine work with what little they have got, and the production values on offer are hugely impressive. The fight sequences impact and are full of gusto. The fight off between Hector and Achilles is superbly choreographed (fought out to a score that James Horner has lifted from the one Danny Elfman used for Planet Of The Apes three years earlier) and the battle between the armies outside the walls of troy sits with the best in the genre. CGI is often called the bane of cinema, but when used so well as it is here (see the ships approaching Troy for instance) it proves to be an effective and entertaining tool.

Troy has problems, of that there is no doubt. But come the end one knows that it has been entertained, one knows that this was a time of heroes. So with that, and the knowledge that the film made a profit of just over £320 million worldwide, Petersen can smugly sit in his chair musing it was job done. 7/10"
r96sk,"A long watch, but just about a worthwhile one.

I enjoyed <em>'Troy'</em>, in short. A film, interestingly given his recent exploits, written by a certain David Benioff. It definitely has more than a few pacing issues, but they only affect the enjoyment factor minorly - at least to me. The score is a little lacklustre, mind.

The casting is outstanding, even if I don't think all the performances are anything to truly shout about. I found Brad Pitt and Eric Bana, although entertaining, a bit wooden in parts.

Elsewhere, Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean are arguably underused from an acting viewpoint - though their characters play huge parts, of course. You also have a load of other familiar faces, from Peter O'Toole to Brendan Gleeson to Rose Byrne to Diane Kruger. The definition of an ensemble.

The action helps keep things moving, the battle sequences are very nicely done. The film takes an age to reach the event that everyone knows about, but when it finally does it's excellent.

The cast and the action are my big takeaways from this. I couldn't comment on its accuracy on the original work. As a film, for me, it's very good."
talisencrw,"Most definitely the worst 'official' James Bond film I have ever seen (haven't seen 'The World Is Not Enough', 'Quantum of Solace' or 'Spectre' yet) but still has its moments, and like The Rolling Stones or Pink Floyd, even the bad stuff is better than 80% of the other stuff out there. Still I wish it wasn't Brosnan's last one--and though Craig was truly a refreshing change in his realistic tone that hearkened back to the great days of Connery, that too got old, even for the actor himself."
John Chard,"Sigh Another Way. 

Die Another Day is directed by Lee Tamahori and written by Neil Purvis and Robert Wade. It stars Pierce Brosnan, Halle Berry, Toby Stephens, Rick Yune, Rosamund Pike, John Cleese, Judi Dench and Michael Madsen. Music is scored by David Arnold and cinematography by David Tattersall.

Bond 20 and 007 is captured and tortured by the North Koreans after being betrayed by an MI6 mole. After being exchanged for a deadly enemy operative, Bond has his 007 status revoked and is forced to go rogue to find who the mole is.

As the Bond franchise celebrated 40 years of being, the film to mark the occasion, ironically, forgot the subtle ingredients that make up the best Bond movies. What we get is a chaotic movie, excess is the order of the day, with Eon allowing Tamahori to stack up scene after scene of video game standard ideas. There is no lack of effort here, the heart is full of good intentions, but some big cheese in a suit should have reined the director in. It's also a sad day in the Bond universe when a Bond film uses homage's to homage itself, only for that idea to tire itself out as well. There is barely any time for reflective silences, for a show of character depth, on the odd occasion the film slows down, gasping for air, Tamahori rushes into the next bit of noise annoys. While the action is often as laughable as the dialogue. This may have made a pot load of cash, but few serious Bond fans would have returned to see this again at the cinema. It's Bond for the non Bond fans, a lazy popcorn no brain for the gamers who just want crash, bang and wallop with no substance. Ssshh, did someone say Batman & Robin?

As the film unfolds in a blur of sledgehammer editing and lack of restraint, not to forget CGI that is shameful, the cast struggle to keep the good ship Bond afloat. Brosnan is on smug auto-pilot, this film proving to be a sad farewell for him from a role he had previously graced with some distinction. Berry is gorgeous but looks awkward with the action scenes and can't carry off the chirpy aspects of the script, though in her defence she's not done any favours by the writers and Tamahori is more concerned with showcasing her twin assets. Pike is OK, sexy and feisty, if a little difficult to accept as a MI6 agent. Stephens, who went on to do very good acting work later in his career, hams it up for all he is worth. Meant to be a shadow characterisation of Bond, Stephens plays Gustav Graves as some posh cartoon character from a Brit sit-com, a world away from the much needed dastard villain opposing Bond. His motives unclear and a victim of one of the film's more berserker twists. Yune is fun with his diamond studded face and old pros Cleese and Dench at least come out of it with reputations still intact. While Madsen is criminally underused.

Elsewhere on a technical front there's also not much to shout about. Madonna's title song, the worst in the series by far, is only beaten in awfulness by her cameo in the film. Tattersall's photography barely registers above the ordinary, with sub-standard location filming not helping either, and Arnold's score is about as far removed from Bond flavours as it can get. There are some good scenes within, a machismo pumped sword fight between Bond and Graves and a laser beam (hello Goldfinger my old friend) dodging fist fight stand tall above the messy quagmire, but the memory of the good sequences are quickly vanquished once the ""invisible car"" is put to field duty use! And with that there really is no more to say about the ""quality"" of Die Another Day. For Bond fans it's about a 5/10 movie, for casual blockbuster fans after a cheap thrill it will no doubt score higher."
Wuchak,"_**One of the top two in Brosnan's stint**_

Agent 007 (Pierce Brosnan) is sent to North Korea to investigate a colonel illegally trading weapons for African blood diamonds. The trail eventually leads from Hong Kong to Cuba where Bond meets Jinx (Halle Berry) and infiltrates a gene therapy clinic in a veritable fortress off the coast. Next, Bond has a thrilling fencing match at a swank club in London with the main villain (Toby Stephens). The final act switches to an incredible ice palace in Iceland and back to Korea. Rick Yune is on hand as the secondary villain, Zao.

""Die Another Day"" (2002) was Pierce Brosnan's fourth and final performance as James Bond and it has the most pizazz of his four movies by far. Its heightened comic book-ness gives it a bad rap, but that’s what makes it stand out from the previous two installments, which had a muted palette and were somewhat forgettable (although entertaining enough). The villains are more memorable in this one and the Bond women are certainly acceptable. The best part of the film, for me, is the over-the-top sword fight at the manor. Although it's so overdone it's somewhat goofy, it may very well be the best sword fight in the history of cinema.

The second half, which mostly takes place in Iceland, has several good action sequences as well, even goofier than the sword fight, like the iceberg tsunami on which Bond surfs (Why Sure!). But it's not like this is the first time an action scene was totally ludicrous in a Bond picture (Remember the ‘Bat Boat’ in the opening of “The World is Not Enough”?).

The first time I saw Brosnan my initial thought was, ""He'd make a great Bond,” and so he does; but it's a different Bond than Connery or Moore and it takes time to get used to him.

Madonna sings the title song (and has a cameo). 

The film runs 2 hours, 13 minutes, and was shot in Maui, Hawaii (opening surfing scene); England (including as a stand-in for Korea); Andalucía, Spain (Cuba); Austurland, Iceland, and Norway (ice car chase and ice palace environs).

GRADE: B+/A-"
CinemaSerf,"Without a doubt, the worst James Bond theme song ever - and it tees up quite possibly the worst James Bond film ever made too. The trail features that now iconic shot of Halle Berry coming out of the water and thereafter there is quite literally nothing at all memorable about this long and meandering espionage thriller. I did find Pierce Brosnan to be a more engaging ""007"" than Timothy Dalton, but here he struggles to make any headway with this particularly, and quite violently, ludicrous plot. It all starts off quite well, actually, with an exciting pre-titles scene that sees our hero stuck in a Korean prison, seemingly abandoned by all. It's only via a prisoner exchange that he finds his freedom and then by way of some diamond smugglers and a bit of sword play with the least intimidating baddie this franchise has ever produced - ""Gustav Graves"" (Toby Stephens), we build to a denouement set amidst an Arctic wilderness. The early films included the roles of ""M"", ""Q"" and ""Moneypenny"" as foils to the star and to his character. Here, we start to see these parts being embellished to fit the status of their actors. Judi Dench is adequate, but dear heaven - what is John Cleese doing here? Another divorce settlement to fund? Rosamund Pike rarely shines for me in a film and she doesn't generate an ounce of menace here - a task left solely to the broadly competent Rick Yune's all but indestructible ""Zhao"". Certainly, there are gadgets - including a nifty Aston Martin with an invisibility cloak. Had I had one at the cinema whilst this was showing, I may well have availed myself of it and skulked out. Time for a change methinks."
Simon Foster,"""While it falls short of nailing the anarchic spirit and character chemistry of Ivan Reitman’s beloved 1984 blockbuster, Feig and his cast of game comediennes deliver enough thrills and giggles to both justify the long-in-development franchise-starter and smother the internet’s white noise of negativity...""

Frank Ochieng,"Filmmaker Paul Feig's **Ghostbusters** reboot pretty much followed the characteristic aspects of his previous films (""Bridesmaids"", ""The Heat"", ""Spy"") all incorporating a self-awareness of female-oriented friendship and the estrogen-driven escapades rooted in inspired goofiness. So given this familiar foundation of Feig's big screen blueprint one would expect that his creative input into the continued Ghostbusters franchise for the millennium moviegoers would result in the heralded hype his film project is now enjoying at large. Sure, the feminine-charged **Ghostbusters** seemed like a radical concept and would obviously trigger the nostalgic sentiments (and comparisons) of the classic 80's comedy spearheaded by beloved on-screen paranormal hucksters Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson. Nevertheless, singer Ray Parker Jr.'s lyrical catchphrase ""Who you gonna call?"" within the Ghostbusters theme song needs to be addressed accordingly. The answer: the handlers behind the original **Ghostbusters** film that could uplift the disjointed high jinks and synthetic silliness of Feig's current comedic ghostly she-power schlockfest.

It is only natural that **Ghostbusters** had high expectations for Sony Pictures to perform well given the aggressive marketing tactics, early release of the Ghostbusters movie trailer (which was heavily panned online) and the aforementioned cinematic legacy of the original film's fanatical following and reputation. However, this third installation of **Ghostbusters** feels curiously flat and strained in its stillborn witticism. The creep factor borders on campy and cheesy (although this effectively worked for Ivan Reitman's 32-year old spook-ridden farce in the eighties) for which in today's cinematic circle is inexcusable due to the edgier and challenging special effects that could have played up the whimsy and wonderment of this breezy, bubble-gum colored romp with seemingly low-grade spark and sizzle.

Feig's interpretation of the **Ghostbusters** universe could have been fresh and favorable especially with the colorful casting of his capable four female principals in the Emmy-winning and Oscar-nominated Melissa McCarthy along with Saturday Night Live personalities Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones. Unfortunately for these noted funny ladies they were saddled (or slimmed if you will) by a transparent script almost as invisible as the pesky ghosts they are trying to pacify. The recycled by-the-numbers hilarity and hysteria does not make this brand of ghost-busting quite distinguishing. Chemistry-wise, the Ghostbuster gals seem to revel in the collective merry-minded mischievousness and genuinely try to bring energy and outrageous antics to this flaccid frightfest. Still, the mixture of Ghostbusters' gooey gumption with a dash of egghead feisty femininity never seems to translate into anything beyond the tired gimmick of promoting another excuse to tap into yesteryear's profitable fun and frolic that made the wise-cracking Murray and his klutzy cohorts so amusing and welcomed in their rollicking ghostly gem from the Reagan-era.

Quite frankly the notion that **Ghostbusters** is unfairly being knocked for its misogynistic overtones fueled by bias Internet-based fanboys not accepting that nerdy womanly scientists cannot fill the shoes of their revered male counterparts from the previous two predecessors is somewhat misleading. Sure, the decision to cast an all-female **Ghostbusters** team turned some curious heads but for the most part many thought this to be rather intriguing and experimental. The actual disdain can be pinpointed to the fact that Feig's flimsy boo-spewing fable is grounded in cliched and forced chuckles, weak-kneed jokes and gags, lazy writing and uninspired visual neon lighting techniques that look like a cheapened explosion from a vintage late 70's New York discotheque.

Unfortunately, **Ghostbusters** wallows in mediocrity and fails to capture the acquired giddiness and imagination so pronounced in the prior entertaining installments. Even if the original actors in Murray, Aykroyd, the late Ramis and Hudson had decided to reprise their roles under Feig's problematic production the results would be the same--an aimless reboot without any definitive bite or backbone for a cobbled comedy that is slight and stretched thin to its toothless core. Amazingly, **Ghostbusters** cannot decide if it should remain faithful to its humble roots (it does help trivially that iconic Ghostbuster notables make scattered cameos--sans Rick Moranis--including that glorified scene-stealer in the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man as well as hot dog gulper Slimer) or venture off into something resembling its own goofy identity and distinction. Either way the third time around simply meanders in over-produced, noisy emptiness.

The so-called plot in **Ghostbusters** focuses on college professor Erin Gilbert (Wiig presumably in the Murray/Dr. Peter Venkman role) and her fascination with ghost activities that end up costing her an academic career in the process. Specifically, Erin's controversial book that she wrote along with co-author Abby Yates (McCarthy) served as the basis for her firing. Abby's obsession with ghosts still has her invested with this spirit phenomenon that she researches defiantly with her kooky associate Jillian Holtzman (McKinnon) in tow. Eventually, it would take the trio's status of joblessness (not to mention a run-in with a slim-spewing ghost that loves soaking humans with its sticky green goo) to collaborate on going into business as paranormal exterminators out to showcase their expertise in ""busting ghosts"".

In the meanwhile, there is something brewing in the twisted mind of supernatural-loving freak Rowan North (Neil Casey). After all, he is the lost soul responsible for unleashing the onslaught of riff-raffish apparitions upon New York City courtesy of his miserable, lonely existence. Now it is up to Erin, Abby and Jillian to eliminate Rowan's sinister agenda and eradicate the spooky pests that he has manipulated to cause the city-wide panic. As Internet sensational darlings, the Ghostbusters are committed to step up to the plate as the sassy saviors they were meant to be since going into the ghost-busting industry.

The later arrival of street-wise transit worker Patty Tolan (Jones) completes the Ghostbusters' quartet. Patty, whose run in with one of the slimy ghosts in the subway tunnel was pivotal to joining the three scientists, has something to offer the ghost-chasing brainiacs--a.) her knowledge of the city's whereabouts and b.) her funeral director uncle's hearse that serves as the official transportation for the Ghostbusters.

Overall, the third outing regarding this toothless entry **Ghostbusters** notoriously lacks the robust impishness and rapport of the male character counterparts that were devilishly drawn together and cemented by Murray's droll humor. Here, the ladies come off as bland and indifferent--at least for the Paul McCartney and John Lennon of the team in Wiig's Erin Gilbert and McCarthy's Abby Yates. McKinnon's Jillian Holtzman is the only truly spry Ghostbuster who is credible as an off-kilter genius ditz with off-the-wall likability. Some may gravitate towards Jones's stereotypical brassy black chick with the brash quips and animated overreactions. Although Jones brings in the high-wire urbanized smirks in contrast to her quieter, geekier counterparts it is cringe-worthy watching her play an over-the-top, towering, mouthy cultural exaggeration that is woefully embarrassing for the sake of this dismissive. hedonistic hoot.

Ironically it is the hunky Chris Hemsworth that fares decently as the handsome himbo Kevin, the dim-witted **Ghostbusters'** male assistant that serves as the doltish eye candy for the cerebral lasses, particularly for the smitten Erin. Another SNL alum, Cecily Strong, checks in as the menacing mouthpiece from the Mayor's office that tries to discredit the popular ghost-busting technicians as ""sad, thrill-seeking women"".

Feig, serving as both the film's director and co-screenwriter (along with ""The Heat"" scriber Katie Dippold) has no cohesive vision for the listless **Ghostbusters** and could have used some critical pointers in studying the proven anatomy of what made Reitman's nostalgic vehicle so engaging that still thrives after three decades since coming into the movie audience's consciousness. From the lame and limping laughs dipped in cartoonish crudeness (i.e. a male ghost gets a rousing jolt to his ""junk"" courtesy of his heroic ghost-busting detractors) to musical acts Fall Out Boy's/Missy Elliott's relentlessly unrecognizable, erratic and choppy remake of the aforementioned Parker's infectious **Ghostbusters'** theme song in this regurgitated comedy that has no excuse for catering to a lackluster rebirth while die hard and casual fans patiently waited for a festive follow-up from Murray and crew for thirty-plus years.

To randomly quote a classic **Ghostbusters'** lyrical line: ""I ain't afraid of no ghosts"". This may be the case but one should be very afraid of this heavy-handed banal boofest for wasting their time, anticipation and consideration.

Linda Robinson,"I was determined to see this movie on opening day. Female cast, Paul Feig (a Michiganian who included a Michigan line in the film), a couple fistfuls of ridiculousity on social media. When the movie started, I was one-eyeing the screen. Waiting for it. Oh oh. Fart joke. Oh oh. Kristen Wiig still can't make her eyes look interested. Then Charles Dance shows up with his serious comic tongue stuck in his cheek to admonish Prof. Gilbert that if she is serious about tenure, she needs to find a more prestigious university recommendation. ""More prestigious? Than Princeton?"" Now I know the deadpan eye comic genius of Wiig, too. From that point on, I was in love with the story. Katie Dippold cowrote the film. She has a bit part as the real estate agent showing the team the 1984 movie's fire station to rent. I want more of her screenwriting. The dialogue is witty, sharp, real. While I liked the 1984 Ghostbusters, it's a buddy movie. Dudes in the treehouse with no girls allowed spelled wrong nailed to the door. Smug, chirpy, guybonics. Venkman electrocuting rivals in the lab: using paranormal research to get dates. Annie Potts drooling over Spengler. Sigourney Weaver in a diaphanous dress, draped on a parapet waiting for the Gatekeeper. The sore spots in 1984 are sprayed away in 2016 without gender disrespect. Gilbert gets to drool over the pretty doofus administrative assistant. When you see this movie, watch all the credits. Chris Hemsworth is a clearly confident actor - he dives pelvis-first into the Kevin role, and it's hilarious. I'm still searching for the creator of the titles and end credits. Excellent art. The poster? Not so much. Hemsworth needs to be behind the four leads. Geez. Casting hit a lick with Kate McKinnon as Holzmann. She is fantastic bringing Harold Ramis' genius back to life. Leslie Jones as Patty: so good, and she has some of the juiciest lines, delivered with haute sass. There are really well-placed cameos by 1984's cast, including birthing one of the movie's best lines ""safety lights are for dudes."" 2016 Ghostbusters is a great fun movie, and I'll watch it more than once again. One of the brilliant visuals that I was thrilled with - the stream from the proton packs tied up the ghosts. Wrapped, pinned, contained lassoed. Genius analogy for what to do with obsolete stereotype. There's a lassoed line in the film while the Ghostbusters are reading the internet reaction to their first catch. ""Ain't no bitches gonna catch no ghosts."" Yeah. Watch this."
talisencrw,"Unfortunately this has become because of political correctness and its backlash almost impossible to rate objectively. In the 2016 North American wish to either redo every successful film ever made and present every conceivable variant in the process, for what could be deemed the lack of any possible originality of ideas, I still tried to enter this with an open mind, and see this as if the two films from the 80's (which I enjoyed very much the one time I saw each of them) had never existed. I should state I saw this in 3D (which I hardly ever do), with my lady and our respective sons.

I felt that it was quite funny and that the special effects were excellent. Next to 'Avatar', the use of 3D was the best I have ever seen. It's a popcorn flick well-worth seeing. Though I haven't seen any other movies by Feig or starring McCarthy, it made me want to go back and give them a shot at some time in the near future. There was something for everyone--both my lady and I enjoyed it very much--and the boys, three and thirteen years-old respectively, loved it as well. Give it a shot."
Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com

There’s an arbitrary sense of nostalgia that unfairly permeates audience perceptions of the new female-centric “Ghostbusters” reboot. I love the original 1984 film too; I wore out my VHS cassette when I was a kid and I’ve probably seen the movie dozens of times, including special theatrical re-releases and anniversary screenings. It’s almost as if all of this animosity is seen as a badge of honor for ‘serious movie fans.’

All of this badmouthing is truly unwarranted, especially if you actually go back and rewatch the original. Sure, the movie has comedy legend Bill Murray, the hilarious Rick Moranis, and memorable performances from Harold Ramis, Sigourney Weaver and Dan Aykroyd. It introduced us to the characters we all still love decades later, and made lines like “tell him about the Twinkie” a permanent part of movie nerd vocabulary. But to all the haters I say this: you are being very, very unfair. The 1980s era film has a lot of boring sequences and lags quite a bit, and as is the case with many movies, sometimes our nostalgia creates pretty thick rose colored glasses. We tend to only remember the good in our childhood favorites.

Put aside your bias: the new “Ghostbusters” honors the legacy of the original, is a fun retelling of the classic story, and it does not disappoint. THIS MOVIE IS FUNNY! THIS MOVIE IS ACTUALLY GOOD!

There are a couple of minor hiccups along the way (as with most comedies, not every joke sticks, and the ghastly Missy Elliott / Fall Out Boy remake of the already awful Ray Parker Jr. song “Ghostbusters” makes an unwelcome appearance), but overall the movie is a success. At first it may feel weird to see women Ghostbusters but any skepticism will quickly fade (there’s a new generation of young girls who will undoubtedly be inspired by these characters).

When estranged childhood friends and paranormal enthusiasts Erin (Kristen Wiig) and Abby (Melissa McCarthy) reunite, sparks are rekindled and they decide to get back to their ghost chasing roots. The smartypants duo is joined by weirdo nuclear engineer Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon) and subway worker Patty (Leslie Jones). When Manhattan starts to experience boatloads of specter activity, the friends get started on some good old fashioned poltergeist hunting.

A big part of why this movie works is the comedic talent of these women; their chemistry is evident and they play well off each other, and the positive themes of loyalty and friendship never once feel fake. All of the actors are proficient at physical comedy and all have impeccable timing. This movie is very funny and the jokes had (and kept) me laughing from the beginning (there’s a particularly hilarious sequence at a heavy metal concert that’s worth the price of admission).

Rounding out the amusing performances is Chris Hemsworth as Kevin, a completely clueless stud muffin who is hired as the women’s receptionist solely based on his beefcake good looks. This feminist spin on the dumb secretary stereotype is exactly the type of lampoon I was hoping for here. In fact, the film doesn’t shy away from all of the lady haters either: there are lots of self-referential bits that directly address all of the critics (my favorite being Holtzmann’s ‘One of the Boys‘ t-shirt). Girl power!

Fans of the original will also appreciate several in-jokes and references, and there’s a long line of fun cameos (which I won’t spoil here: just keep your eyes open and be sure to stay through the end credits)! The special effects have been given a serious upgrade as well: these ghosts look real, feel real, and are appropriately scary-yet-funny. When the ladies first fired up their proton packs, I began cheering internally.

“Ghostbusters” is exactly what a summer movie is supposed to be. It’s big in scope, it’s full of hearty laughs, it’s filled with terrific performances from all of the leads, it’s stuffed with stunning special effects, and it’s something the entire family can enjoy. All of you naysayers really need to lighten up because this is a really, really fun movie.

Reno,"**The ghosts are real and the scientists are hunting them down!**

First of all I am not a fan of the original film, but I enjoyed watching them. So I anticipated this film for the updates to deliver what I'm looking for, including some good jokes, but I found it an average film. I am very interested to have the women's version of hit the films and vice versa, but there are not many films in this category. All I wanted was 'The Expendables', but they made this one. I think it was a great idea, though the execution was really impressive.

The story was okay type, they kept it very simple. No big developments, except two main characters. But all the four women were good, along with Chris Hemsworth as a worthy sidekick. The director whose favourite casting actress, Melissa McCarthy's fourth film with him in four years and he did his job well, but the screenplay lets the film down.

There's no major comparison with the original, because this is a reboot and obviously has similar appeal from visual to comedies. Except they talk too much science thing because of todays advanced science. The disappointments are the ghosts, the film did not give preference for them to show their atrocities. I mean the perspective was always from the women gang who fights them. Definitely a one time watchable film, for its decent graphics, performances and some good comedies.

Per Gunnar Jonsson,"This movie was a huge disappointment! The only positive thing I can say about it is that the special effects where not half bad. The movie itself was childish, unfunny, unintelligent and generally really bad.

Some reviews giving this movie 9 or 10 stars (which is just ludicrous) are saying that people cannot handle the feminism in the movie. What feminism? Replacing the original actors with women is not feminism as far as I am concerned and anyway, if you care about such things should it not have been two women and two men to be politically correct? Also, the supposedly intelligent women in this movie behave in a typical old-fashioned Hollywood stereotype of women way. They are mostly downright silly. If I were a feminist I would actually have been insulted by this movie.

Then we have the male clerk that is dummer than a piece of rock. If someone had stacked four supposedly intelligent men and a single blond bimbo that is totally devoid of any trace of intelligence together in a movie the social justice warriors would have cried foul so loud that you could hear it across the planet. But since it is four women and a stupid male it is okay (not really). It is even feminism according to some people. What a load of bollocks.

There is actually a story in the movie although it is well hidden under the silly jokes and silly behavior. It is paper thin and rather silly in itself but it could have worked if the rest of the movie was up to snuff but sadly it is not.

As I wrote above the only good thing about this movie is the special effects. The few scenes that I actually enjoyed was during the big shoot out at the end which had some cool moments. I especially liked when Jillian pulls a pair of pistols out of her Ghostbuster suit and goes on a ghost killing spray.

Apart from that this movie is best forgotten."
bob9000,"This movie is horrible. It plays like an overly long SNL sketch. The only saving grace is that this lost so much money that there will not be a sequel. Unfortunately for the fans, this means that the franchise is likely dead in the water for a long time."
hankster3000,This movie is a disaster. The casting is way off. The special effects are mediocre. The story is merely a retread from the original... and they shoot the original logo in the crotch. There is nothing good about this production. What a waste of a perfectly good franchise.
in_the_crease,"As a male nerd who grew up in the 1980's watching both original movies and the cartoon, running around with my toy proton pack and catching imaginary ghosts in my basement, I should be of the demographic complaining about how this ruins my childhood or that a cast of all women is just a stunt in the name of political correctness, or whatever their issue is. But the truth is, I REALLY enjoyed this movie. 

The four female leads were absolutely hilarious--especially Kate McKinnon who steals every scene she is in. The other three characters have more growth, more of a story arc, and are more fleshed out as people in general. But McKinnon makes the most out of the available material and creates a very fun and memorable character.

The comedy of the 2016 version, while equally effective, is completely different from the dry humor of the original. The absence of Dan Aykroyd's and Harold Ramis's ludicrously funny lines delivered with a straight face, and the deadpan humor of Bill Murray has been switched out with a more over-the-top and in-your-face style of humor. It's not as subtle. Ghostbusters (1984) made me chuckle; Ghostbusters (2016) made me laugh out loud.

While a lot of the original's comedy came from the ghosts themselves, i.e. that they're funny instead of legitimately scary, the new version reverses that. There is some very creepy imagery involving things like old timey parade balloons, ghosts pushing against mirrors, and other things that seemed inspired by American Horror Story. Plus, there were some good jump scares, boo moments, that actually caught me off guard. 

Much like a guitar amp out of Spinal Tap, this film turns both the scares and the comedy up to 11 with great results. 

I haven't had this much fun at a movie in a long time. The trailer is NOT a valid way to judge this film. The trailer seemed to splice together all the ineffective moments and jokes of the film. But those were the exceptions and not the rule. The rule here is fun, entertainment, laughs, and the occasional scare. When the film works, it works remarkably.

The only real misstep was Chris Hemsworth's character. While the gender role reversal of the hot blonde ditz secretary was brilliant and long overdue in a mainstream summer movie, he was just too dumb to be believable. The character of Kevin belonged in a cartoon and not a legitimate movie. 

The best line in the movie references Jaws and Annie Potts' cameo made me cheer. 

However...

If you've already decided you hate this movie without even seeing it, you probably won't like it. That's how these things usually work. But, if you have an open mind and are reserving judgement, I suggest you see it. You will be pleasantly surprised."
Gimly,"I didn't watch this for quite a while because I heard so many bad things about it. ""What do they know?"" I thought to myself. I figured _Ghostbusters_ had already had a bad sequel I sort of enjoyed, a bad remake should be sort of enjoyable too. Besides, you just **know** that so many of the complaints were exclusively because the cast had been of the dreaded ~~fEmaLe VeRsiOn~~ variety. But I just watched it, and... Oh man you guys, this really did suck. I'm devastated.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"
r96sk,"First things first, the following is worth noting: I have no attachment to the 1984 film, nor do I particularly like it; I rated it and its sequel 2½*. I'm not saying it's overrated or anything, I just personally don't enjoy it that's all.

With that said, I'd class 2016's <em>'Ghostbusters'</em> better than the original. However, as you tell by my rating, that's not me saying this is a good film. I don't believe it is. It's incredibly slow paced, with a very forgettable and untidy plot. It felt longer than a 116 minute run time, that's for sure.

It's not all bad, though. I actually rate the casting. Melissa McCarthy can be hit-and-miss, but this is one of her more solid performances. Kristen Wiig, great in <em>'Bridesmaids'</em> alongside McCarthy, is a decent performer too. Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon are alright, while Chris Hemsworth is pretty amusing.

I, despite not being a fan of it, still enjoyed the callbacks to the '84 film; as well as the use of the superb theme song. As for the special effects, they look good but none of the ghosts stick in my memory; both visually, but also in terms of the story. It would've been nice to have a standout ghost. Likewise with the film's villain, who is ridiculously plain.

In conclusion, it does positive things but there are certainly negatives. All in all, I think the latter just outweighs the former unfortunately. 3*."
John Chard,"It's Bayhem time again.

An asteroid the size of Texas is heading towards Earth, the consequence if it hits is a global killer, the end of mankind. In spite of the billions invested in the space programme, NASA has no answers other than the notion that the asteroid will need to be nuked, from the inside. Enter Harry Stamper and his rough and rugged crew of deep core drillers. Can NASA get these men up on the asteroid and do the job? The fate of mankind rests with a bunch of odd balls!

Perhaps because I have a particular kink for the disaster picture, I find it hard to understand the hate for Armageddon. I am after all a man who gleefully defends The Towering Inferno et al with staunch defiance. Armageddon does exactly what was expected from it, ridiculous high octane entertainment with laughs, peril and obligatory chest thumping bravado. All of course cloaked in director Michael Bay's gleeful insistence on blowing things up with devilish panache. Sure there are some twee moments, sure there is some less than great acting on show, but you know what? It's a disaster picture for Michael Bay's crying out loud sake! Check the brain at the door, turn the sound and colour systems up, enjoy the effects on offer and singalong to Aeromith's smashing, ""I Don't Want To Miss A Thing"".

Armageddon, does exactly what it says on the cover, don't take it so serious folks. 8/10"
Kamurai,"Good watch, might watch again, and can recommend.

This has a great premise and stacked cast which is incredibly well balanced not only between the ""diggers"", but the control crew and the astronauts as well.  While they take that opportunity use the characters to really build the world, the story really just boils down to ""meteor going to kill earth"" and ""guy and girl connection, but girl's daddy doesn't like"".  Surprisingly the latter takes up a significant amount of time in the movie, but everyone gets their moment in the spotlight.  Steve Buscemi definitely has some of the most memorable moments in the movie.

This is the first movie I can think of that has this sort of detail of space travel, let alone tried to simulate the hellish landscape of an asteroid.  It really feels like they put the production value into not only to making the movie look good but getting the details right.

This is a ""I laughed, I cried"" sort of movie, and while I don't think it does any one thing especially well, it definitely delivers a solidly good experience."
CinemaSerf,"This starts off quite entertaingly as ""Stamper"" (Bruce Willis) discovers that his daughter ""Grace"" (Liv Tyler) has been having a romance with one of his employees ""AJ"" (Ben Affleck) and so chases him around a drilling establishment taking pot shots at him with a shotgun. Sadly, though, this silliness is soon replaced by a greater one as we discover a great meteor is heading our way and ""Stamper"" and his team might be the only hope for mankind. Egged on by ""Truman"" (Billy Bob Thornton) they must quickly learn to be astronauts, then by way of a Russian space station, head into space to plant a gazillion ton nuclear bomb on the thing so it will split up and harmlessly pass us by. This is probably Willis at the top of his game, lively and mischievous and Affleck was at his most eye-catching, but the rest of this just just fits nicely into the well trodden sphere of sci-fi disaster movie. The visual effects are fine, but the dialogue is pretty pedestrian and the ending has a cheesy sentimentality to it that made my eyes roll. It is far, far too long. We spend at least an hour faffing about on the preamble, establishing the characters and when finally lift off comes, I was not entirely convinced the meteor wasn't welcome. There is quite a fun contribution from cosmonaut ""Andropov"" (Peter Stormare) who knows just how to fix high-spec technology, but otherwise this is all just a rather colourful vehicle for the star that is enjoyable enough, eventually, but really nothing to phone home about."
dgood826,I’d say the movie holds up a lot better all these years later because 1. it’s not right after the first MIB and my expectations weren’t super high and 2. after years of seeing Will Smith either not care enough about the movie to try or try too hard to get an Oscar it was awesome to just see him having fun and doing what he does best again. You can read more of my review here: https://imdgflicks.wordpress.com/2017/06/29/throwback-thursday-movie-review-men-in-black-ii/
Gimly,"I don't know that _Men in Black II_ is really thaaat much worse than the rest of the trilogy, as most other people seem to think. I mean, in my opinion, it's actually better than the third. But these are all basically the same movie. So they can only go so right or so wrong from one to the other to the other. It's not awful (well, the faces on that poster are, my god), but it's not like... good.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
Wuchak,"_**Fun sequel, but not as good as the first one**_ 

Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith and Rip Torn return in this sequel about a secret government agency based in New York City that deals with extraterrestrial interactions on Earth.

Like the original 1997 movie, ""Men in Black II"" (2002) is amusing & thrilling in the first half, but loses its mojo a bit in the second half where some of the jokes fall flat. If you’ve seen the first film, there’s no need to see this one; but, if you want more with slight variations, then check it out. It’s the lesser movie, but it still fills the bill for when you’re in the mood for fun & thrilling popcorn entertainment.

On the female front, Linda Fiorentino is absent, replaced by Lara Flynn Boyle as the villain and Rosario Dawson as a pizzaria employee that catches Jay’s eyes. Meanwhile, the stunning Paige Brooks appears in a couple of small scenes.

The next two sequels are: Men in Black 3” (2012) and “Men in Black: International” (2019); the latter is the only entry in the series (so far) without Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith.

The film runs 1 hour, 28 minutes, and was shot in New York City & surrounding area (e.g. Fire Island for the Post Office scene), as well as Los Angeles/Culver City/Pasadena.

GRADE: B-/C+"
Kamurai,"Decent watch, probably won't watch again, and can only recommend if you REALLY liked the first on and MIB International isn't available.

They literally start the movie by subtly explaining why the formula doesn't work without Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, hell Patrick Warburton would have been an AWESOME option to be in the movie for real.

This is a weird one because the movie is well cast, it has an interesting premise and villain, and the story is well written up to a point.  And hell adding Rosario Dawson makes anything better, but this one just lands weak.  They seem to do a worst job of showing us all the same tricks (sometimes literally) from the first movie, but Agent K feels shoehorned in, and the resolution isn't satisfying at all.  Maybe if there was an epilogue, but the movie is from the perspective of the MIB and they're planet side only.

The threat is also weird.  They could have taken their time and did a mystery movie, but instead they put a clock on it and rush it so it's barely interesting and there is no connecting logical dots for deductions.  Then it's arbitrary when the do figure it out, and there is no explanation of why, how or what actually lead up to that.  It is literally no information leading up to a fact, then no information resulting from that fact other than a simple reaction.

The first movie is just better, and MIB International is a lot more fun."
Wuchak,"_**Entertaining and thought-provoking, even moving**_

""Beowulf"" (2007) is an animated version of the epic poem of antiquity featuring Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie and Robin Wright Penn. It uses live action motion capture animation, which was previously utilized for “The Polar Express” (2004) and “Monster House” (2006). Although it's a ""cartoon"" it's the equivalent of an R-rated picture with brutal violence and openly sexual situations & dialogue.

The film has the same characters as the epic poem – Beowulf, Hrothgar, Wiglaf, Grendel, Grendel's mother and the dragon – and the three Acts split between Beowulf's fight with Grendel, Grendel's ""sea hag"" mother and the dragon; other than this the film deviates from the poem with some interesting ideas to tie everything together. Needless to say, don't watch if you're a Beowulf purist.

However, if you don't mind the animation or the re-imagining and enjoy sword & sorcery adventure like Conan, you'll likely appreciate this. It's both entertaining and thought-provoking. I recommend watching it back-to-back with 2005's ""Beowulf & Grendel,"" which is a live-action version with Gerard Butler and Sarah Polley, shot on the gorgeously bleak landscapes of Iceland.

I should add that, not only is this a beautiful film to look at, animated or not, it also has an excellent epic Viking-ish score by Alan Silvestri, highlighted by the main title, ""What We Need Is A Hero,” and the two versions of ""A Hero Comes Home,” the first is the shorter version sung by Robin Wright-Penn whereas the second, sung by Idina Menzel, plays during the end credits.

The message of this animated version is that the reality behind the story is much different than the legend because it has been embellished over the years. Some reviewers complain that Beowulf isn't a genuine hero, but he’s certainly heroic, faults and all. He's a bold warrior who takes on the gargantuan and intimidating (not to mention UGLY) Grendel NAKED and somehow defeats him! He then goes on to lead a mighty Nordic kingdom for decades to come. If this isn't heroic, what is? So he exaggerates his past exploits and has a weakness for women, what else is new?

The main lesson, aside from the one noted above, is that new political leaders tend to make the same mistakes as past political leaders, so new leaders should be careful or they'll experience the same pitfalls.

Other morals include: Apart from redemption, the ""sins of the fathers"" will cast a pall over the family or community and eventually come back to bite 'em (literally, in this case); even the greatest heroes are human and have serious flaws; deal with your past mistakes (sins) or the guilt & shame will drain the life from you and your environment; it'll also make you wish you were dead; offer a man unlimited power, wealth and fame and he'll likely go for it no matter the cost, selling his soul to the devil, so to speak; men are easily entranced by feminine beauty, regardless of how obviously impure her intentions; the importance of saying you're sorry and forgiving; the importance and ultimate triumph of love.

Some things to chew on: Why is the dragon one-and-the-same as a noble-looking gold-skinned man? Does this signify he's a cross between malevolent blood and noble blood (mother and father respectively)? Is the golden man his spiritual side and the dragon his dark side?

Some criticize that Beowulf is not a Christ-figure, as in the poem, which isn't accurate. (***SPOILERS FOLLOW***) Although late in the story Beowulf mourns that there are no heroes in the new Christian era, only ""weeping martyrs,"" ironically he goes on to be an obvious type of Christ by sacrificing himself for the people of his kingdom (the world) by slaying the dragon (the devil). Keep in mind that, according to the Bible, all things were created through Christ, which would include the angel Lucifer (a “son of God”), who later devolved into Satan. Likewise the golden man in the movie is the son of Beowulf and ultimately revealed as a hideous dragon.

All human types of Christ are flawed because humans are flawed, even “heroes” like Beowulf which, again, is one of the main points of the film. Hence, Beowulf's perception about ""weeping martyrs"" is faulty and can be attributed to his fallen condition when making the statement. Later, he rises out of the ashes to slay the dragon and sacrifice himself for the people. Right before doing this he declares his love for his wife and asks her to forgive him for his past failings.

One scene had an impact on me. Years after becoming a king, Beowulf boldly confronts a defeated Frisian warrior who mocks him on the Nordic coastline. Beowulf commands his men to step back, discards his sword and challenges the warrior to kill him (at this point the Frisian has picked up his battle axe). Weaponless, Beowulf yells at him with every fiber of his being, ""KILL ME! DO IT! KILL ME! KILL ME!"" Why does Beowulf do this? Is he invulnerable and, hence, has no fear of death? No, the ending shows that he's wholly mortal. Actually he's so burdened by guilt and shame that he no longer even cares if he lives or dies. This is reality.

The film runs 1 hour, 55 minutes.

GRADE: B+"
JPRetana,"Beowulf hasn't aged well; it looked like crap when it was released in 2007, and it looks like old crap 15 years later. This movie plays like someone made a videogame based (loosely, natch) on the epic poem, then took all the cutscenes out and edited them together into feature length. Now, if only Beowulf came with an option to skip the cutscenes.

The film features human characters animated using live action motion capture animation, but I fail to see why they even bothered. Five years after The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, which was the first feature film to utilize a real-time motion capture system, the novelty should have surely worn off; moreover, this technology hasn't aged any more gracefully than Beowulf has, and even today the best motion capture in the world can't make a silk purse out of the sow's ear that is even the best computer-generated imagery in the world – in fact, putting the two together is just piling crap on top of crap.

It's too bad, because a good live-action film could be made with Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, and Ray Winstone – though not a good live-action Beowulf film, mind you, because it would still go the CGI route for Grendel and the dragon and who knows what else; a fully animated movie would at least be consistent, or in this case consistently crappy.

Not that consistency is something of which one could accuse Beowulf; some characters look vaguely like the actors who provide their motions and voices (namely Hopkins), while others not at all (Malkovich) – and there there's Winstone, who looks for all the world like a poorly-rendered digital version of Sean Bean."
Wong,"Kung Fu Panda 3 does not disappoint. It has great animation, great music, and a great story. We loved it. My son, who is 9, enjoyed the story and thought the movie was very funny. The panda theme was adorable as pandas are cute animals. Also, the scary guy wasn't that scary - and was more funny. Jack Black is hilarious and everyone in the theater was laughing. There were some sad moments and some happy moments but you leave the theater feeling uplifted. If you like action movies, you will like this because many things explode but there is no gore. The colors of the film are quite beautiful and lush. Go see it! You will enjoy it. Take your kids."
Reno,"> This time no Skadoosh, but Chi time.

Three successful films in an animation franchise is a great achievement and according to the production house, yet another 3 films are going to hit the screens in a decade of time. So if you are an animation fan, especially 'Kung Fu Panda' and Po's fan, brace yourself for the future treats. This film was amazing. After two wonderful adventures, now this story has calmed down a bit with simplicity. Visually, it was spectacular with all those fight sequences, but the story was quite dramatised with enough comedies and then the final battle to conclude the 3rd installment on a high note.

I think it was a well designed storyline in advance keeping in mind 5 to 6 films, that's why the flow was very smooth between all the three with those flashbacks placed at the right place. This particular part belongs to Pandas, the furious five were absent in most of the film, but good to see the return of Oogway. The master Oogway comes at the beginning and then during the end, though very happy for presence as he's my favourite character in this franchise. He's not a big player, but like Yoda, he's amazing and tell me who won't like him.

This time no Skadoosh, but a new villain with a battle fought for a new powerful thing called Chi. Now Po got a promotion, so I'm very excited for the next film for how it will going to turn out. This is a beautiful family film and must not miss it. All the cast was returned from the previous two and a few more new were recruited and it is set in a new location for the most of the narration like the most of the animations has done in China. After all made in China is not so bad.

8/10"
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"Kung Fu Panda 3 is about what you would expect. A roller coaster ride of gags, goof ups and outrageous martial art outbursts.

Po is himself, clumsy, naïve, martial arts master and funny. As usual he is accompanied by his friends from the previous movies including the somewhat reluctant Shifu. The wise turtle Oogway from the first Kung Fu Panda is back as well, kind of.

Naturally there is a big bad villain, General Kai, who it turns out have some past relations to Oogway. General Kai is pretty good as a villain with a suitable maniacal expression on his face. Then of course, a bull in itself is already projecting bad temper and violence so it is a good start.

The main story is of course about defeating General Kai but Po’s reunification with his (real) father and the rest of the, funny and very clumsy, inhabitants in the Panda village is taking up a large part of the movie.

In general the story is quite nice with some nice twists.

It should come as no surprise that Po, as usual, saves the day in a cataclysmic showdown with General Kai. There are some great animation effects in the final battle.

At the end of the day this is a quite recommendable family movie."
Gimly,"Perhaps what I'm missing with _Mission: Impossible_ is the big screen experience. Because I'm just not really feeling the love with this franchise. 15 years down the road since the first film and it still all feels a little unfocussed and silly to me, despite how beloved I know it is.

That all said, and though the villain here is certainly no Phillip Seymour-Hoffman of _M:I:III_, I still felt this was the strongest entry of the franchise so far. They even finally figured out that women can be used for more than just a damsel-in-distress, throwaway-set-piece or eye-candy. They haven't moved terribly far past that point, but at least they're changing it up a little. This fourth entry also adds a little levity, something a series that has always been a little dumb, is well served by.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._"
CinemaSerf,"This is almost as good as the first outing - almost 20 years ago - for ""Ethan"" (Tom Cruise) and he finds himself on the wrong end of an evaluation from the US Government - led by ""Hunley"" (Alec Baldwin) that wants to dissolve the IMF. He and ""Luther"" (VIng Rhames), meantime, are on the trail of the ""Syndicate"" - a criminal organisation that poses a real threat to the peace and security of the nation and to his organisation. Co-opting ""Benji"" (Simon Pegg) and ""Brandt"" (Jeremy Renner) they soon come across the enigmatic ""Ilsa"" (Rebecca Ferguson) who wants to help out, but why? What now ensues is a tautly directed thriller with plenty of action that takes us all around Morocco and Europe before quite a gripping conclusion to the intrigue leaves everyone unsure who they can trust. Christopher McQuarrie seems to have decided to go back to the television series for reference here, the teamwork (even from the usually terrible Pegg) and the plot develop more plausibly and excitingly; it has a grittier and more substantial story to it, and even if Cruise looks a little unkempt from time to time, that narrative is just better - it actually is a thriller rather than just another piece of star-led boisterous entertainment. Like most films that depict the principle of US Senate oversight, it continues to poke fun at the (in)competencies of that body to even make a proper cup of coffee; there is some humour in the dialogue and it's put the franchise very much back on track."
mooney240,"**Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol takes an already great formula and upgrades it with bigger stunts, more character development, and an expanded universe.**

Ghost Protocol tops the list of best Mission Impossible movies and sits near the top of best spy films. Ghost Protocol ratchets up the action, the stunts, the comedy, and the allure while still delivering a compelling and entertaining story in ways the franchise hadn’t mastered before. The world of the IMF expands beyond its star agent Ethan Hunt by showing agents on other missions and giving Hunt’s team backstories and development. Brad Bird’s Pixar charm rubs off on the film with fun, quirky moments punctuating the incredible action set pieces and providing a little breathing room in the intense face-paced plot. The quality of new characters and the pedigree of the actors playing them seems to prepare the franchise for spin-offs or even a changing of the guard (if Tom Cruise ever wanted to pass the movies on to a new lead). Ghost Protocol sets a new bar for the Mission Impossible series that causes its successors to thrive as they reach for its level of excellence. If you didn’t want to watch all 6 (and soon to be 8), Ghost Protocol wouldn’t be a bad place to start."
Andres Gomez,"Enjoying story inspired in 4 of the major ""legends"" for kids in the anglosaxon culture.

Great animation and development of characters for a simple and clean story with the needed touches of humor and action."
Matt Golden,"The Sandman. The Easter Bunny. The Tooth Fairy. Santa Claus. You know their names. But did you know that they were secretly the guardians of childhood, brought together by the Man in the Moon as a sort of folkloric Avengers? Well, now you do.

They don't seem to have a lot to do however (aside from their respective day jobs, of course), until their long-vanquished nemesis The Bogeyman returns to threaten the world. To shore up their ranks, the Moon summons forth another figure of legend: the plucky winter sprite Jack Frost. Jack and the Bogeyman share a common problem: they're not believed in anymore, and have faded from public view. But Bogey has found a way to regain his power, and this spells doom for the other Guardians (and, presumably, childhood innocence).

It's a decidedly high-concept start, as most CGI fare tends to be, based on an in-progress series of books by writer and filmmaker William Joyce (who wrote and directed the utterly charming, Academy Award-winning short animation The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore, which I can't recommend highly enough; bring tissues). There's some mucking-about with the established tropes: each of the Guardians have different names (North, Bunnymund, Toothiana, Sanderson Mansnoozie, Pitch Black), and visits to each of their strongholds reveal Yetis do the day-to-day work at the North Pole (elves are instead well-meaning but useless idiots) and Easter eggs are grown like flowers, among other revelations. I'm sure you can discern how everything turns out in the end. Surprises aren't legion in films of this type; like any fairy tale, it's all in the telling.

There are a few issues with the film, and they're mostly structural: normally I'm not one to carp about world-building (and this is clearly a film with eyes set on a sequel), but the first half seemed to drag on a bit too long for me. These are archetypal characters; one of the reasons they're used is so that we get the idea at the merest glance. The second is that the villain of the piece, Pitch, feels like a missed opportunity. He's a mite over-exposed and a bit too solid. This is, after all, the Bogeyman. Employing a bit more of the Jaws principle and amping up the menace and threat that he poses may have instilled more fear in the youngest audience members, but how many of us were forever traumatized by the flying monkeys of Oz, or Willy Wonka's psychedelic tunnel ride? Kids today have it easy.

Quibbles with the building blocks aside, the execution of what's there is sterling. Character designs are unique and witty, from the Australian warrior rabbit (Hugh Jackman) to the silent, squishy Sandman to the tattooed, inexplicably Russian Father Christmas. Jack Frost, whose design seems informed by the classic Rankin & Bass stop-motion film, is well-voiced by latter-day Star Trek captain Chris Pine, and Alec Baldwin brings his gravelly voice to bear with a hearty bombast on the sword-wielding Cyrillic Santa. Jude Law is seductively mischievous with his turn as Pitch, and Isla Fisher is a bundle of nervous energy as the flighty, OCD Tooth Fairy.

The film itself is gorgeous, with cinematographer extraordinaire Roger Deakins serving as visual consultant (other animated films for which he's performed this role are Rango, How to Train Your Dragon, and Wall-E; I think that's enough to say if you're making an animated film, bring him on). I can't speak for the depth of the 3D-ification, but rather than suffer through a dim, dull image, you'd be better served to witness the full, gorgeous colors of each of the Guardians' realms.

Guardians is a cut above most animated fare, but with a bit more tweaking (and perhaps more involvement from executive producers Joyce and Guillermo del Toro, each of whom have immaculate fairy-tale credentials), it could have been a classic. The film we have, though, is an enjoyable ride, even if it doesn't have the staying power of its legendary characters."
Erin Taylor,"A delightful movie for children and families. Interesting twists on some of the figures of childhood, however, they are very likable characters. The Story is well thought out and pulls you in, I actually felt concerned that good would not triumph over evil. Great ending, but it kinda leaves you wanting more.  Another Dreamworks hit, sure to entertain the family."

Reno,"**A guide on how to get through during unemployment.**

I thought I have seen almost all the films of Jim Carrey, but then I found that's not true, so I decided to start with this. This is a remake of the 70s film or you could say the second screen adaptation of the novel of the same name. I haven't seen the other version, but I must admit that I enjoyed it thoroughly. This is not the greatest comedy I have ever seen, but still so good with great performances, particularly Jim Carrey's.

A simple storyline, a couple loses their jobs and they find hard to get another. They begin to lose one by one, everything that belongs to them and finally the house is the last thing they want to lose. So they plan to do something very serious thing to tackle their situation and seems its working out so well, but for how long. Then comes their masterplan to the permanent solution and how they accomplish it is what leads to the conclusion.

The film was so fast, feels too short or like a TV episode. That means makes us to feel to have more, but it ends very nice way. The story might feel silly, but the comedies are so good. And if you like Jim Carrey and his trademark jokes, then you would have a great time. Truly, I haven't seen a good comedy from the recent time releases, so I'm happy I saw this, even though it is a decade old. There's no serious negative stuffs in it like drugs, sex or nudity, so I think it is okay for family viewing.

TopKek,"Edward Zwick's ""The Last Samurai"" is about two warriors whose cultures make them aliens, but whose values make them comrades. The battle scenes are stirring and elegantly mounted, but they are less about who wins than about what can be proven by dying. Beautifully designed, intelligently written, acted with conviction, it's an uncommonly thoughtful epic. Its power is compromised only by an ending that sheepishly backs away from what the film is really about.

Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe co-star, as a shabby Civil War veteran and a proud samurai warrior. Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a war hero who now drifts and drinks too much, with no purpose in life. He's hired by Americans who are supplying mercenaries to train an army for the Japanese emperor, who wants to move his country into the modern world and is faced with a samurai rebellion.

The role of the samurai leader Katsumoto (Watanabe) is complex; he is fighting against the emperor's men, but out of loyalty to the tradition the emperor represents, he would sacrifice his life in an instant, he says, if the emperor requested it. But Japan has been seized with a fever to shake off its medieval ways and copy the West, and the West sees money to be made in the transition: Representatives from the Remington arms company are filling big contracts for weapons, and the U.S. Embassy is a clearinghouse for lucrative trade arrangements.

Into this cauldron Algren descends as a cynic. He is told the samurai are ""savages with bows and arrows,"" but sees that the American advisers have done a poor job of training the modernized Japanese army to fight them. Leading his untried troops into battle, he is captured and faces death -- but is spared by a word from Katsumoto, who returns him as a prisoner to the village of his son."
r96sk,"Recommended.

<em>'The Last Samurai'</em> features some very cool and entertaining battle sequences, which are shot excellently. The premise itself is attracting, it's acted out astutely by the noteworthy cast list. It probably lasts too long, but I never truly got a feeling of it dragging out though.

Tom Cruise is fantastic as Capt. Nathan Algren. It's no secret or surprise as we all know that guy can act, he adds a great deal to his character here; especially on the emotional side of things. As for what happens with Algren, it's all good even if the love interest parts are undercooked.

Ken Watanabe is splendid in the role of Katsumoto, while Masato Harada (Omura) and Timothy Spall (Graham) give positive performances. It's also nice to see Billy Connolly (Gant) and Scott Wilson (Swanbeck) appear. Hans Zimmer's score is, as presumed, grand. That would be one of a number of reasons why I'd say you should watch this."
Reno,"This is a well known story and I have also seen the '56 movie 'The Ten Commandments'. So in this film could not foresee the modification, but it did in a slight manner like the later 'Noah' movie. The best part was the visuals, the graphics were so good, hard to resist the pleasure if you are vfx geek like me. That's the reason I love modern movie, especially remake of a classic like 'King Kong'. The problem in this flick was lie in the story telling.

As we know, Ridley Scott is an excellent narrator, but this movie was too short even though it ran 150 minutes. I felt it was just a brief, I mean there were no details or depth in the important scenes. You will know what I'm saying if you had watched '56 movie I mentioned in a above paragraph. That's drawback for the first timers at a same time advantage for not to fall in boredom for those who have already seen other versions. Christian Bale, awesome; Joel Edgerton, good; Ben Kingsley, never required; Aaron Paul, totally waste.

Overall, not cleverly stablised in the scenes that are very important, especially the final one about ten commandments should have been extended a little bit with a moral message. If it was a Peter Jackson movie, definitely it would have been a trilogy with an aggregated time of over 500 minutes. This movie was an entertainer like I enjoyed it than the message deliverer. Must be watched for the amusement and for the pleasure in updating technical aspect of the narration rather than inspiration.

Per Gunnar Jonsson,"This movie was rather disappointing as far as I am concerned. The original story has been rewritten rather drastically. This in itself do not bother me too much. I am not one of those fanatics that get a fart stuck the wrong way if someone messes with the holy bible. However, I really do not think this was a good rewrite. A lot of the magical moments had been removed and that took away a lot from the story.

The movie starts off good enough with some nice and fairly impressive battles. Then it slows down a lot and sometimes I got a “get on with it damn it” feeling. When we finally got around to the burning bush part I got rather underwhelmed. God as a vengeful kid? Come on!

The disasters and the special effects are not too shabby but the entire bit where Moses confronted Ramses and warned him about the disasters that where to befall Egypt are taken out. They where just thrown on Egypt one after another in ways that could be explained away as natural disasters. From one point of view I can understand the wish to do this but to me it took something away from the movie.

Later when Ramses decides to go after the Hebrews it continues in the same way with Ridley Scott downplaying the magic in the story. There is no pillar of fire and Moses is not holding out his staff to split the see. The sea just decided to recede and Moses takes advantage of it. Sure the effects when the water returns where quite cool but again, the magic was gone.

Technically the movie is quite well done and the acting is quite okay but the biblical grandeur and mythical aspects are no longer there. This grand adventure story is simply reduced to an ordinary, fairly mediocre adventure movie with a high budget. I have to say that I enjoyed Cecil B. DeMille’s The Ten Commandments more even though the special effects in that one is hopelessly outdated and the acting is a bit awkward."
Gimly,"**The following is a long form review that I originally wrote in 2013**

I did like _Star Trek_. I did not, however, appear to like it as much as the rest of the whole damn planet.

I appreciate the decent helping of Australian actors in the mix (like personal favourite Chris Hemsworth, above). I can get behind the colourful and impressive special effects spectacle. Most of all I dig the reboot angle they pulled. The whole time travel/tangent universe thing is the perfect breeding of remaining true to the original, while still not constricting themselves to the old canon. Fantastic idea.

But I didn’t love it. I’m a big fan of origin stories, but I personally feel that _Star Trek_ never really breached past that point. The first half was brilliant, getting to know the characters, the world, the ideals, everything. But in the latter half it seems they just sort of went “Well, we spent a bunch of time doing stuff good, but now we don’t have enough time left to make an actual movie out of this… Oh well, just chuck an hour of lasers in there and we’ll worry about that next film!” which just isn’t good enough. When _Into Darkness_ comes out later this year, the format will probably pay off, but looking at the merits of Star Trek alone, I think it fell short.

Simon Pegg (_Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead_) as the new Scotty and Zachary Quinto (_American Horror Story, Heroes_) as the new Spock were both solid choices, but other casting decisions like Winona Ryder (_Black Swan, Alien: Resurrection_) as Spock’s mother were an off-shot in the worst possible way.

I suppose though, in science fiction, it’s often safety first and little steps. As a member of what is probably the most frowned upon of the genres, I wish this Star Trek reboot all the best in its inevitable future, and it seems it will make good use of it. But for now, the solo film itself didn’t reach as far as I felt it could have with a little harder work towards the end.

John Chard,"A franchise re-energised-big time! 
 
It's not an understatement to say that the news of a new Star Trek movie was met in equal measure by suspicion and pretty low expectations. Step forward J.J. Abrams to direct it, and many wondered while the guy behind TV series ""Lost"" and ""Mission Impossible III"" would want to dabble on hallowed sci-fi turf?. Things were further eyebrow raising when Abrams openly admitted to not having been a fan of the original show so cherished by a legion of Trekkies. Then news came of the film being a prequel, based around the Starfleet Academy and the coming together of what we know as the U.S.S. Enterprise crew. ""Ooh that will be a tough one to carry off"" said many, ""Kirk & Spock as young spunkers - surely not"" they said. Well not only did Abrams pull it off as it were, he simultaneously appeased most Trekkies whilst garnering a whole new generation of sci-fi observers. Budgeted at $140,000,000, Abrams Star Trek went on to gross Worldwide $384,953,778. Figures that, even allowing for the huge fan-base that the franchise has, show that many first timers not only went to see it - but also that they enjoyed it so much they went back for second helpings. I know I did.

The success of the film isn't hard to fathom, because although Abrams upped the action quota (with a number of breath taking and eye appealing sequences) he also dispensed with much of the sci-fi psycho babble that has blighted some of the previous filmic instalments in this most up and down of franchise's. Sure there's stuff in there for the discerning fan, with a time travelling revenge plot at its axis, how could there not be?, But Abrams and his writers (Roberto Orci /Alex Kurtzman) keep it simple, savvy and sexy. They smartly link to Trek lore with a crucial plot and character development featuring the Kobayashi Maru, while pain, emotional conflict and personal crisis all feature heavily. This is, one can ""logically"" say, a spiky post 9/11 Trek movie. There's even room for a romantic strand, a strand that is tender and fits the whole make-up of the piece perfectly. All of which only works because the cast are, in the main, producing great work.

Getting Leonard Nimoy to appear in a small, but crucial role, is nothing short of being a master-stroke. His presence keeps the all important essence of Star Trek within what is ultimately a reboot. It's like a father figure watching over proceedings, making not only the cast feel safe, but also us the viewers. The youngsters in the cast are impressive, Chris Pine (Kirk), Zachary Quinto (Spock) and Zoe Saldaña (Uhura) lead from the fresh faced front. While Karl Urban (Bones McCoy) and Simon Pegg (Scotty) impact with comic relief that aids instead of hinders the plot developments. Villain duties falls to Eric Bana as Romulan Captain Nero, he's a touch miffed is Nero, and Bana brings the character's vengeful pain vividly to life. While Bruce Greenwood as Captain Christopher Pike adds a touch of class that he almost always seems to do.

This U.S.S. Enterprise has launched itself in another direction, and yes, it's boldly going where no-one has boldly gone before. It is, all told, a bona fide blockbuster with brains and balls. The like of which has sadly been missing from many a modern era summer release. Yes it's not all perfect, the odd scene could quite easily have been jettisoned, and some accents need a bit of fine tuning, but they are very minor complaints. A triumph from Abrams and his team - note the Stardate in the ships log, for this is a noteworthy moment in modern sci-fi cinema. Now comes perhaps a bigger challenge, the notoriously difficult second film...  10/10"
tmdb44006625,Sam Raimi's Spider-Man captures the spirit of the comic book hero and it's still one of my all time favourite superhero movies. It lays out the perfect blueprint for a superhero origin story that I love revisiting every year or so. I've always been able to relate to Peter Parker growing up. Tobey Maguire and Co. delivered a great interpretation of the characters in a way that still can not be matched.

katiegofanywhere,"If you loved the first How to Train Your Dragon, you'll absolutely love this movie. If you are a frequent user of Tumblr, you'll want to capture SO many moments in .gif format. If you've never seen the first movie, you'll still love this movie, or at least, like it.

Essentially, this movie is great. It has all that a child could desire in a film (trust me, the kids in the theatre LOVED it - it was super cute) and it also had some absolutely hilarious moments for the adults. The plot is pretty good; even if it is predictable, it's predictable in a way that works. The animation is gorgeous. The voicework is awesome. The way all of the characters have grown over the 5 year gap between the two movies in the series was really well done and evident, not just in appearance, but also in their personalities and interactions with each other.

In any case it was a lot of fun! Go watch it, even if you don't have kids."
Reno,"Like I said a couple of year ago during 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2' review, it's a terrible title for a sequel. The host, Neil Patrick also said the same thing during the 2015 Oscars. But in the digital world, slight change in the title makes random in order. I mean on the computer and web world, it won't show in order. Even sometime it might get lost in a vast number of other titles if they dare to chance the first word in the title for a sequel. Other than that they are not stupid as many people think. That's why they highlighted 'Dragon' boldly than the rest of the words.

This part two was not much different to its first. The story continues five years after Hiccup recovers from his injury. He and his pet, Toothless discovers a new land during the survey for the map. So their's adventure begins, but end in a trouble and forces all his people from the town to involve and fight against the rising evil force that tries to conquer them all.

Like I always say, those days are gone, now animated movies are for all ages. This was a very nicely and carefully written screenplay, did not fail to deliver. Very close to the impact the first movie made, but due to simplicity it stayed a couple of steps behind. Developed well with a bit of suspense, thrill and entertainment. Nothing more we could have asked, a perfect follow-up and hoping to explore beyond lot more in the upcoming movies in this series. Four years gap between the movies is a nice idea and fine breathing space for this franchise fan. A movie must be seen by animation fans, especially if you have already seen the first then don't miss it.

Andres Gomez,"The first one was good and the second is not any worse.

This series is standing out of the pack for its complex plot involving several topics, not just the typical ones in an animated movie. Arguably, they have been also treated in former movies; two main characters which are crippled (Finding Nemo ...), greater involvement of strong female roles (although, still, not as main characters and utterly in need of help from the male roles), ecology, etc.

The points I dislike the most is the speech of homeland being the good ""peacekeeper"" nation forced to use violence to keep it (peace). Quite hypocritical but, clearly, addressed to the US audience.

The repetitive line of story about the (nerd) hero who is the only one to save the world is quite tiresome too.

Finally, how lightly some other traumatic causing topics are treated: finding that a parent abandoned their child, death, etc ...

In any case, this is a good movie, funny and with an interesting story. Worth watching for a franchise that, I think, doesn't have all the attention it should have."
Reno,"> A fight among the gods, for the Egyptian empire.

I like this director, but this is not his best work. I think the Hollywood fed up with Greek stuffs, now they're looking at the ancient Egypt. Where's the next stop? India? This film was not a bad idea. I liked the story, a mission based concept, but I did not like the CGI. Visually, it was okay, though those CGI characters felt like they're from sci-fi. I think they inspired by the ancient Egyptian arts. Other than that, this film is enjoyable.

At least I knew about Greek deities, I learnt a few words and names about Egypt mythology through this. Gerard Butler in a negative shade was good and the other actors too decent. I was not interested in this film, but now somewhat I enjoyed it, that mean they should stop it here, no sequel please.

I had no issue with the casting, it is a marketing strategy. You can't just put a new foreign face in front of the camera and make money out of it. Cinema itself means fake display. Age, skin, death, everything is fake. So people must learn to accept it similar to when a black, Malaysian or Indonesian man says he's a mooslim, but genetically he's not, just converted to.

Well composed stunt sequences, especially bloods with liquid gold, totally got the PG13. Least expected film of the year, but got entertained better. It got the mixed response and mostly negative feedback from the critics, but who knows you might have a good time like I did. So you could try it if you want in your free time, because it is not worth to spend your valuable time.

Gimly,"The illegitimate child of _Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen_ and _Marvel's Thor_. One that probably should have been aborted.

I could see _Gods of Egypt_ working in the ""dumb fun"" kind of way, if it hadn't been so bloated and overly long. As it stands, it has some very neat design choices... And that's it. That's all it has going for it. Not a single actor seems to care that they're in this movie, the digital effects are hit and miss at best, and the story is sillier than it had to be, yet not as entertaining as it could have been.

But yes. Some great designs.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
CyrusPK,"Fantasy is very difficult to get right in films.  Audience resistance is quite high, especially when it involves characters with difficult-to-remember names or diverse place names.   Relating to a fantasy world of beasts and magic is often tricky for audiences who may prefer grounded, realistic drama.  There are exceptions though – the worlds of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings captured public imaginations and the complex mass of stories and themes in Game of Thrones also attracted an audience.
This fear of fantasy seems to have informed a slightly tentative approach in the writing and direction of Gods of Egypt.  There are plenty of fantastic creatures present ranging from giant, vicious snake like creatures to Minotaurs in all but name, and an array of Egyptian gods.  However, there has been avoidance of any of the cod Shakespearean dialogue that often permeates works of this type and an emphasis more upon realistic dialogue.  This creates a needless tension between the intensity of the innovative visuals and the prosaic words dropping from the actors, a tension that is never resolved as the linear story progresses forwards but never upwards.
The pleasures with this film arise mostly from the intensity of the visual experience.  Every environment has been precisely designed, full of colour and dimension, looking very different from the landscapes seen in past films based on myth and history.  The benefit of this is that there is always something to attract the eye, from great sky barges to rainbow lit waterfalls and massive monuments.  Like all Alex Proyas’ films the visual ideas add weight and substance that the scripting sometimes fails to.
It is however that narrative which brings the film down with a series of very deliberate events extrapolated in excessive detail, burdened by actors who at times look deathly uncomfortable in their roles.  Only Geoffrey Rush, in a small but notable part, really excels with so many of the others not able to bring life to the dialogue as they intone in front of ever present green screens.
In the end it is a pity that such a wonderfully conceived world at the visual level could not have been combined with a compelling story and acting."
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"When the credits rolled after having watched this movie with my kids I was perplexed. I knew this movie had not received very great ratings and I had heard rumors that some people had even labelled it the worst movie of the year. However, I had liked watching the movie…a lot!

Sure, the script is predictable and certainly wont win any prices for best script anywhere. The acting is adequate but no more. But it is a fun fantasy adventure movie, a simple adventure / action fantasy roller-coaster. Plenty of fairly cool special effects. Some humor, some romance. It is also fairly devoid of politically correct preaching, whining, mentally unstable and self destructive “heroes” and all that crap. In short it is the kind of movie I like.

I actually looked up the movies page on Wikipedia and it was pretty much full of nonsense and whining about how the movie was not “ethnically correct”. What the f…? It is a bloody fantasy adventure movie for Christ sake! It is meant to entertain! Who the hell cares about whether the actors are native Egyptians or something else? Well, I guess Eskimos would look a bit funny in those roles but otherwise…

Yes it does take quite a few liberties with Egyptian mythology but again, it is a fantasy movie guys! And Egyptian mythology, like any other mythology, goods etc, is nothing but fantasy and story telling from the start so just live with it. To me they stayed true enough to the core of the mythology and I would actually give the director and script writers bonus points for actually depicting the earth as flat as was the predominant belief in those times. Those scenes with Ra dragging the sun and the flat Earth was quite beautiful actually.

The rating on IMDb is also on the low side but of those that took the effort to write a review most seems to be quite positive. The mostly negative ones are, of course, the so called “critics”. No surprise there.

It is sad to see how a, in my opinion a quite entertaining, movie can be so sabotaged by a bunch of, again in my opinion, loud mouthed, ignorant, intolerant, fanatical SJWs who seems to believe that a movie cannot be allowed to just entertain but has to carry a political message, their political message.

I would recommend anyone into fantasy and adventure movies to check this one out if you should stumble upon it. I certainly do not regret adding it to my collection."
John Chard,"The comic book geek blockbuster for adults only.

Watchmen is directed by Zack Snyder and adapted to screenplay by David Hayter and Alex Tse from the Alan Moore/David Gibbons graphic novel. It stars Patrick Wilson, Malin Ackerman, Billy Crudup, Jackie Earle Haley, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Carla Gugino and Matt Frewer. Music is by Tyler Bates and cinematography by Larry Fong.

1985 and someone is killing all our superheroes. Time for the remaining super heroes to band together - but what they find as they fight the good fight is potential annihilation for everyone.

It was quite a battle getting Watchmen onto the screen, over twenty years of legal wrangling and controversies, it got to the point where fans of the source material doubted it would ever happen - and even if it did it was sure to be a monstrous failure. How pleasing to find that not only did it make it to the screen, but it is also a genre bending winner - well to some of us of course...

One has to take into context just how potent and original the graphic novel was back in 1986/7, we are dealing with very mature themes, superheroes with serious psychological baggage. Alan Moore lit the touch paper in the comic book kingdom that the rest have since followed to keep the torch burning well into the new millennium. Snyder has achieved top line results in getting both the feel and look of the source, even if some of Moore's cunning cynicism has been lost in translation.

Story is set right in the middle of nuclear paranoia and the fear of the Soviets in 85, the America we view is dank and depressing, noirish in vibe (aided by Rorschach's clobber and detective inclinations), it's a world on the road to nowhere. We are also at a time in the alternate world where superheroes are banned from operating, forcing The Watchmen to become vigilantes - that is if they can get along and shunt their psycho discord to one side. The back stories of the main protagonists are fully formed, and these are not jolly characters, so much so you worry the fate of mankind is doomed if these are who we rely on to save us.

There was in no way that Snyder would be able to produce a comic book filmic adaptation that would be as worshipped in that sphere, to rival that of the worship the novel has in its own. However, coming at it as someone who only sought out the source material after seeing the film, it shines bright for newcomers who are ironically seeking darker tints in superhero tales. Oh it has the requisite nifty twists (a clinical mystery to be unearthed), booming visuals, excellent effects work and smartly constructed action set-pieces, but narratively it's moody and calls for the utmost attention on dialogue passages (I have found it gets better on repeat viewings).

Snyder clearly cared about the project and that love is evident in the movie. It was never going to appease all and sundry, but at worst to hardcore Moore fans it's at least an honourable failure, to many others it's a smart and stylishly refreshing genre booster. 8/10"
MSB,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)

First of all, this review is based on the theatrical version of Watchmen. Usually, Director's Cuts or Ultimate Editions are not preferred over the original release. Few films benefit from them, and most are simply an extended cut with a bunch of deleted scenes. It's only fair and rational that a reviewer watches the version which the whole world saw at the theaters at the respective time. With that said, despite knowing the story of the source material, I never indeed read it. Having in mind that most of the ""hate"" that this Zack Snyder's movie received is from comic-book purists (basically, every book/comic/game/whatever-lover who defends that any cinematic adaptations of any of these sources MUST be 100% the same, with no modifications whatsoever), I'm certain an unbiased perspective is the way to go.

And overall, this is a good feature. Watchmen isn't just another CBM (comic-book movie). It doesn't just follow one hero vs. one villain. It's a whole world (in today's standards, it's really a cinematic universe) of ""superheroes"" meant to be explored in fine detail (hence the release of a TV show today... reviewing that later). It's an extremely complex world that needs to be thoroughly explained in order to deeply understand how it works, and what's everyone's role in it. This is the film's main problem: it struggles to juggle all of its different storylines and distinct characters. Even with 163min of runtime, it's impossible to squeeze in all of the necessary information.

So, as expected, Snyder and his team of screenwriters had to simplify, shorten, or even wholly dismiss some story elements that would only stretch the runtime to an unfathomable length. Some of the adaptations work brilliantly, but some fail to give a character its importance or offer no interest to a subplot. However, it's still easy to understand everything, and how the ending is going to unravel, which leads me to my second issue with the movie: its final act's heavy exposition.

Like I wrote above, there is a lot of information to deliver. What Snyder did very well was to tell most of it through flashbacks or captivating conversations, but in the final act, where everything was self-explanatory and in no need of more exposition, there is an excess of redundant dialogue that doesn't really add anything relevant. What the characters are saying is significant, yes, but we, as the audience, already know all of that way before the film's climax. It's ironic how they make a joke about villains telling their masterplan to the hero and how this villain isn't dumb enough to do it, but then proceed to carefully explain everything (that we know already) through exposition.

Sincerely, these are the major problems that I have with the movie. However, I love so much about everything else. From the appropriated and fun soundtracks to the beautiful production design, Zack Snyder and his crew really do a fantastic work technically. Snyder's style captures Watchmen's world perfectly. It's one of those films that carry a ""feel"" due to its stylish cinematography. I love how little CGI is actually applied (I'm obviously ignoring the big blue guy), and the abundance of practical effects and real sets that are used. The action sequences look spectacular, way better than a lot of blockbusters nowadays (10 years later!).

Despite the terrific technical achievements, my main compliment is actually connected to my number one problem. Even though the storylines are incredibly hard to balance, characters like Rorschach, Nite Owl, Silk Spectre, and The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) have extraordinarily captivating and entertaining stories. There might be a few missteps here and there, but Snyder made ONE movie from a material that's worth a whole TV show or at least two films. And he delivered a GOOD one! Probably a better job than 80% of the directors working today could ever achieve. Finally, the social commentary is still quite relevant for this new generation, and if the so-called ""source-material-purists"" didn't exist, this movie would be a lot more appreciated.

All in all, Watchmen is as good as it could be, having in mind it's just one film with already a long runtime. Its narrative was always going to be extremely difficult to tell in a solid yet compelling manner, and Zack Snyder does struggle with balancing all of the storylines and its characters. However, he and his phenomenal team still delivered a good flick. Technically sublime, with a distinct style, brilliant production design, and gorgeous cinematography. Characters like Rorschach and Nite Owl have amazing moments, filled with excellent action sequences, but also with emotionally powerful scenes. If it could be better? Maybe. If it could be split into two or three movies. As it stands, as one and only film, it's really impressive even with its flaws.

Rating: B"
David,"As humans, we are drawn to what inspires us, interests us, and tickles our fancy. Human opinion can be a fickle thing, especially when it comes to film, books, and music, due to this the message that is interwoven through these mediums are missed by all of us simply because we won't take the time to watch, read or listen to what is being said to us.

The message throughout Watchman and Tales of The Black Freighter in film and more importantly in graphic novel form is that we as humans try so hard to make the world a better place, but being pushed so far while trying to rid the world of evil we become the very thing we're fighting against, sometimes this a fact we do not see, or we do when it's too late. When Alan Moore wrote the story for the graphic novel, he did so at the height of this planet's greatest threat of nuclear annihilation; The Cold War, The U.S. and Russia at a stalemate over nuclear arms, and Russia's invasion of Afghanistan, had meant that at any moment millions of people on this planet could have met a brutal end.

As far as the story goes, this is a concept that has been warped, and manipulated into a alternate universe where in 1985 Richard Nixon has changed the constitution of the USA and made it allowable for him to serve more than 2 terms of Presidency, it's also a universe where in the times after WWII ordinary citizens decided that crime and corruption throughout America, and especially New York had gotten to levels beyond the control of authorities that they would suit up as masked vigilantes, and fight crime head on. By 1985 masked heroes are outlawed, and former ""heroes"" were forced to reveal themselves, or stay hidden, but give up their lifestyle.

The story of the most part is told through the eyes of one character Rorschach (Haley) as he investigates the murder of a fellow vigilante, The Comedian (Morgan). Rorschach is the only vigilante who has not given up the lifestyle, and is wanted by the F.B.I. Rorschach tries to re-engage the remaining ""heroes"" to help him find the murderer, and get to the heart of why he was murdered. The other ""heroes"" are Night Owl II (Wilson); an aging recluse who inherited a fortune from his father and used it to engage in vigilante activities, Silk Spectre II (Ackerman); daughter of an original Minutewoman (Cugino), Ozymandias (Goode), a self made millionaire who has modeled himself and his life on Alexander the Great, and Dr. Manhattan (Crudup), the only real superhero due an accident in a atomic chamber in a lab when he was a physicist.

The film follows pretty closely the themes and tone of the book, much more than any comic related movie before it, thanks mostly to the dedication of director Zack Snyder. The look and feel of the film to date it in 1985 was very well handled, and can certainly be called a period piece due to the level of exact detail through-out. Performances are in general pretty well done, and reflect the emotions of the characters in the book, as this is the Ultimate Cut, the extended scenes, plus the interwoven story of the comic book within a comic book; ""Tales of The Black Freighter"" make for a film that is worthy of its 215 minute length. Having said that they leave well and truly enough of the story in the theatrical cut where the message still shines through.

The credits for this film are the best I have ever seen, using the Bob Dylan song ""The Times They Are A-Changing"", and features snapshots of the highs and lows of the Minutemen and Watchmen from the 1940's through to the 1980's against the backdrop of important cultural and political icons and events.

This movie is easily one of my favourites of the modern age of film, because of the well delivered message, and the uncompromised approach to bring the graphic novel to life."

_Watchmen_ polarised audiences when it arrived in theatres in 2009. Coming not long after Marvel's _Iron Man_ many were expecting a fun action oriented super hero movie. _Watchmen_ however, is not that kind of movie. Just like the source material it comes from, this is a dark and brooding film that deals with some complicated questions.

Here is the official description:

_In a gritty and alternate 1985 the glory days of costumed vigilantes have been brought to a close by a government crackdown, but after one of the masked veterans is brutally murdered, an investigation into the killer is initiated. The reunited heroes set out to prevent their own destruction, but in doing so uncover a sinister plot that puts all of humanity in grave danger._

Starting off with a fantastic montage that, with barely a word, fills you in on the alternate history of the movie, and the timeline of things leading up to the start of the main story, Watchmen does a great job of building this world you are about to inhabit for two hours and 45 minutes. The characters are strong, and develop logically over the course of the film, and you can really feel their sense of despair or feeling of not belonging. I think of all the comic book movies I've seen, this one captures best those feelings the characters have of being lonely outsiders. Rorschach's commitment to the truth in the movie leads to a brilliant defining moment was where it all just bursts out from him. It was very well done. He, as a character, is so good that I think he deserves his own movie in the same noir-ish style.

The length and style of this will turn a lot of people off, it is much more of a character piece than a big explosive action extravaganza. In my opinion, it's one of the better comic book movies out there.

Top all that off with a fantastic sound track of 1980s music and this is a pretty good package. If you like bright lights and shiny tights, this is not the comic book movie for you. If however you like a super hero movie with some depth and that deals with some philosophical questions this will give you a lot more to chew over than some other DC adaptations."
Wuchak,"_**The ""Apocalypse Now"" of superhero films**_

Based on Alan Moore's graphic novel, 2009's ""Watchmen"" takes place in an alternative 1985 where Nixon is serving his fifth term and costumed vigilantism is illegal. A former masked crimefighter named The Comedian is murdered, prompting his previous teammates to investigate the crime. Things get complicated as the backstories of most of the Watchmen are revealed and worldwide nuclear war looms.

For some reason I was never interested in the Watchmen and therefore never read the graphic novel, even though I had the opportunity. Why? The fact that it took place in an alternative reality turned me off, as did the peculiarities of the team members which, I later discovered, Moore intended as satire. That said, this is mind-blowing. ""Watchmen"" is an adult-oriented superhero flick with a convoluted plot, strong characters and total originality. The latter two score high marks with me any day.

Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) stands out with his gravelly voice and right-wing ideology, although he's not very likable. He's impressive yet, at the same time, kind of pathetic. The character was based on Steve Ditko's The Question.

The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) exudes great charisma and is reminiscent of The Punisher, if he were a jokester. Unfortunately, The Comedian's arrogant & hotheaded and has a weakness towards the ladies, not to mention cold-blooded murder.

Night Owl (Patrick Wilson) is another strong character, obviously based on Batman or Blue Beetle. Unlike the previous two he's very likable. I always thought his costume looked really lame in the graphic novel but, as depicted in the film, it kicks axx.

Dr. Manhattan (Greg Plitt), named for the Manhattan Project and based on Captain Atom with a dash of Mr. Fantastic, is an almost God-like being who can do pretty much anything. He's so detached from the human experience that he walks around totally nude and has no time for his woman, Silk Spectre II. He'd rather hang out on Mars -- literally!

Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) stands out due to her sexy costume more than anything else, not to mention Akerman's drop-dead-gorgeous looks. The character was based on Phantom Lady and Black Canary. Silk can't handle Dr. Manhattan's increasing aloofness and consequently diverts to Night Owl for human warmth.

Silk Spectre (Carla Gugino) is Silk Spectre II's mother and has a pretty significant part. Like her daughter, she's hot, albeit in a whole different way.

Ozzyosbourne, whoops, I mean Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) is the least developed character and loosely based on Charlton Comic's Thunderbolt. He's ultra-smart, ultra-quick and kinda foppish.

Another highlight is the hypnotic score by Tyler Bates mixed with a quality soundtrack (e.g. ""The Sound of Silence,"" ""All Along the Watchtower,"" etc.)

BOTTOM LINE: The film is long, dark, mature, dialogue-driven and convoluted, but the strong characters and originality win the day. No moronic ""blockbuster"" trash here. Not to mention Silk Spectre II and her mother are extremely easy on the eyes. As far as superhero flicks go, there's really nothing else like ""Watchmen."" It's even more atypical than the X-Men and easily one of my favorite superhero flicks, maybe even THE favorite. ""Watchmen"" is like the ""Apocalypse Now"" of superhero films!

RUNTIME: Theatrical Cut: 162 minutes; Director's Cut: 186 minutes; The Ultimate Cut: 215 minutes

COMPARING CUTS: I own both the theatrical cut and Director's Cut. Although the theatrical version is just fine, the DC is worthwhile for extended dialogue to existing scenes in the theatrical cut; the biggest addition is an attack on Night Owl's Mentor, Hollis Mason, at the hands of a thug gang and Night Owl's subsequent brutal revenge at a bar. Despite the convoluted plot, I had no problem following the story in the theatrical cut, even though I've never read the graphic novel. The filmmakers did an excellent job cutting out the fat in the theatrical version. So don't think you'll need to purchase the DC to understand the story; it's not necessary. My recommendation is to check out the theatrical version first and only purchase the DC if the theatrical cut left you wanting even more, which is what it did for me. Even so, I PREFER the theatrical cut; it's leaner and just all-around better.

GRADE: A"
Cwf97,"Ang Lee helped revolutionize superhero related films forever with Hulk (2003). Rather than just have the hero try to save the world, Lee and James Schamus decided to have Bruce Banner deal with his Freudian psychology, specifically the repressed memories he had thirty years ago about his father.

The acting talents of Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, Nick Nolte, Sam Elliott and Josh Lucas are perfect for the five main characters. Bana was able to do intentional wooden acting to hide his character's repressed emotions while Connelly conveyed kindness as her Oscar winning role from A Beautiful Mind (2001).

What I loved about Lee's interpretation is that he did not care about faithfulness. He cared about showing a cerebral kind of superhero film that later got imitated with The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005-2012), Watchmen (2009), Logan (2017), Dawn of Justice (2016) and Suicide Squad (2016).

Ang Lee is one of the best directors to have ever lived and Hulk is one of many films he directed for great proof."
lori007101,"The Green Giant is awakening!
As a little baby, the Offspring Bruce Banner Genmanipulativ is changed. Later, as a young man, he is a scientist himself and is employed with gamma radiation. He wants to try to reach scar tissue and injuries, using the radiations, a healing method. Through an accident with the radiation, banners mutate when he has a tantrum, to a Green Giant: the Hulk!
Eric Bana plays the shy and vulnerable Bruce banner. Although he does not really trust the role, he mastered the insecurity in person, sovereign. 
Jennifer Connelly plays Betty Ross. Connelly embodies Betty cool and sober. It is only when she experiences how banners mutate that she shares a helping emotion.
Josh Lucas plays Glen Talbot. Talbot is fully fixated on his career and is a smug Sesselfurzer. He wants to develop the invention of banners for the military and thus create super soldiers. He has every means right for that. Lucas was arranged as a little villain. Unfortunately, he doesn't necessarily come across like that.
The military commander Ross, is portrayed by Sam Elliott. Elliott plays his character cool and iron. He really wants to protect his country. That is why he acts defending and patriotic for his country. 
Although Nick Nolte has at least playtime, he plays his role most deeply. The few minutes of presence, is a pleasure of acting. 
The visual language of the director Ang Lee is very special. His idea of using certain settings as a split screen is also closer to the Marvel Comics. So that you really also realize the Hulk is a comic book template. 
The effects from the year 2003 are good, but you can already notice certain Unperfektheiten.
The animations are still kitschy. Which seems a bit ridiculous, too. The story leaves a lot to miss. On the one part, because Hulk belongs in the MCU, here the humor and sarcasm is very rare to see. The colourful and colourful MCU can not be classified here. The story is portrayed here rather as a fantasy drama. Which then looks rather dull for a comic book template. 
In the last third, it is right to the point and it is going to be quite an effect thunderstorm. It's really a pity that you have to wait more or less until the end until the Hulk drops off steam. 
Conclusion: A down-to-earth stand of the character hulk of Marvel Comics. Unfortunately, it diminishes the story through seriousness and dramaturgy that happens!"
tmdb44006625,"I mean, what was everyone expecting? They hired a director who does mostly Asian art-house movies to helm a comic book movie about a green monster who smashes things when he gets angry. Of course Ang Lee was going to delve into Freudian concepts, overtones of Greek tragedy, and strange editing choices.

My issues with Hulk are more focused on its painfully slow pace and messy third act. Yes, the whole movie seems a bit pretentious, but you have to at least admire the intent and ambition to make this movie, even if the execution is wonky."
JPV852,"This is actually the third time seeing this, not because I liked it nor am that big of a fan of the toy line it spawned from, but saw this in the theaters, then again on Blu-ray and now on 4K Ultra HD, the latter two times for review. I had doubt this third viewing would make much of a difference and while I found it entertaining and perhaps a slight upgrade in rating (2.75 vs 3.0) and that it was better assembled compared with The Rise of Cobra, including visual effects that was a massive improvement over the video game-y crap in that film), it's still not all that great.

I liked the cast including Dwayne Johnson and cutie Adrianne Palicki; while Bruce Willis was alright, albeit phoning it in (I assume he needed to pay off his mortgage to appear in this as the 'Joe' of GI Joe). Doubt there will be a fourth time outside of the ""Extended Action Cut"" (not included in the 4K Ultra HD set unfortunately), but it's a non-descript and somewhat forgettable popcorn sci-fi action-thriller. **3.0/5**"
Kamurai,"Decent watch, might watch again, but can't recommend unless you're running out of things to watch or are an action archaeology fan.

This was a weird attempt created a 2005 version of Indiana Jones, or, since this is in Africa, Alex Quartermaine with Matthew McConaughey, of all people.  I'm not aware of Matthew McConaughey or Steve Zahn being big action stars, but they surprisingly manage to handle their own, even if it isn't always believeable.  Rainn Wilson and Penelope Cruz get in on the action as well....if that helps.

The premise is a little interesting: they're looking for a U.S. Confederate boat in Africa.  Because it's not interesting enough on it's own, Penelope Cruz is a doctor trying to stop a plague coming from a war-torn country.  It all feels a like ridiculously improbable things happening in a world that is far too realistic rather than a world created of fiction that houses an incredible story.

The movie is heavy with plot armor, despite any cleverness the characters have.

It's fine to watch, but there has to be something else that you can watch that is likely going to be better."
furious_iz,"**What was cutting edge in 2001...**

...now just looks like an average cut-scene from a PS2 game.  Soooooo all you have to rely on is the plot, and that is thin to say the least.

Weak characters, weak plot and really jerky unnatural animation make this once ground-breaking film look awkward and uninteresting.  Couple that with the facts that it bares very little resemblance to the addictive if basic games, and the script feels like it was written with google translate, the whole film ends up feeling flat, confusing and leaves you wanting more."
xenocast,"True to ""Captain America,"" this is the modern (comic book) version of the All American movie.  Good guys versus bad guys without a lot of ambiguity.  _**NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT**_.  

This movie is pretty much perfection for the genre. Entertaining A to Z story with high-end Hollywood professional movie making throughout."
Gimly,"**This is a long form review initially published in 2011:**

Though it ran at over two hours, I did feel that it had plenty of room to go further than it did. I honestly felt like Red Skull could have had a film all to himself, and actually kind of suffered for making him as intriguing as he was.

Chris Evans was an interesting choice as the titular role of Captain America, given that he's already played American sweetheart Marvel Super Hero ""The Human Torch"" in _Fantastic 4_ and _Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer_. He didn't Oh-My-Gosh blow me away type-thing or what have you, but he was pretty great.

So far in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I'd slot Captain America clean in the middle. I liked _Iron Man_ and _Thor_ more, but _Iron Man 2_ and _The Incredible Hulk_ less. Marvel Studios stated that the movie they wanted to make was set in the 40's, even though the rest of Marvel Cinematic is modern-day. This was 100% the right move to make, why? Not because of the setting, aesthetics or direction, but because it's fuckin' smart. How do you have the world appreciate an Uncle-Sam loving upper-middle class white male military blindly-loyal patriot? You make him fight the God damn Nazis, that's how.

It may seem strange, but I actually enjoyed the opening of _Captain America_ the most, which he spends a a meek, asthmatic Steve Rogers, yet to undergo the Deus Ex Machina Super Serum. It really showed the best of Evans acting ability, as well as the writing of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely whom together wrote _You Kill Me_ and The _The Chronicles of Narnia_ Trilogy.

I watched it in 3D, which was more bearable than usual. As the films of MCU progress, each of them becomes more and more a prequel to _The Avengers_, _Captain America_ being the most to date. Despite its almost-entire lack of _Avenger_ cameos, this more than previous films felt like a prequel for what's to come, which is not strictly speaking a good thing.

I had plenty of minor issues with _Captain America_, and though their was quite a number of them, all were minor, and ultimately, the only part of me that regrets watching it was the part that keeps thinking ""My fucking God, I have to wait a YEAR before _Avengers_ comes out?!""

PolyWogg,"PLOT

Steve Rogers, a scrawny young man, wants to enlist in the US Army and go overseas to fight in WWII. But his size and health means his attempts at enlistment always end the same way -- a 4F rating. Until a scientist sees him and recruits him to try out for a special training program to create a super soldier.

WHAT I LIKED

The Marvel universe sticks pretty close to classic script with him being given a serum that jacks his body into super muscle mode. He's already brave and smart, so it would seem like a no-brainer to send him overseas? But the guy in charge of his training doesn't want him, he's just one man, so Rogers ends up doing public relations back home. And he is quite shocked that the men overseas don't react as positively when they see him as the crowds back home. I really enjoyed the way they handle the first battle scene for him, basically him figuring things out as he goes, a far cry from his battle-hardened approaches later.

I even liked his interactions with Agent Carter. I had thought it would be more subtle than it was, and I hoped we'd see a bit more of her operating on her own (after all, they gave her character a whole series on TV!), but she was second fiddle to the hero.

WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE

The challenge with a lot of American movies of the war is that it is as if they are the only actors in the war, no allies, just them, and that level of nationalistic narrowmindedness is a bit grating. That may be a small gripe when the show is called CAPTAIN AMERICA, not CAPTAIN OF WORKING WITH ALLIES, but still, it's annoying. I also was disappointed there wasn't a lot more on Red Skull. His history, his abilities, other pursuits, all of it was left basically unreferenced. Sure, some of it shows up elsewhere in the Marvel universe, but a bit more crosswalk would have been nice. I felt he really wasn't that well-fleshed out as the uber villain he could have been.

THE BOTTOM LINE / TWEET

As an origin story, it lacks pizazz"
tmdb44006625,"Definitely the most underrated of all the MCU films, Captain America: The First Avenger is a great war film done comic book style about a little guy making a big difference. Red Skull is one of the better villains simply because of how fantastic Hugo Weaving is. Peggy Carter is a great heroine and Hayley Atwell's performance is an absolute joy. Also, Tommy Lee Jones and Stanley Tucci light up the screen whenever they're on.

With strong action scenes, nicely developed characters, and seamless CGI, Captain America: The First Avenger is perfectly fine as a stand alone film. Shameful that so many audiences were just going out of obligation for The Avengers, because this movie has a lot to offer."
JPV852,"Probably only my third time viewing and first in at least 8 years and while it's not great, I did find it to be pretty entertaining and Chris Evans embodies the role so well. Red Skull and the heavy prosthetic they placed on Hugo Weaving still was pretty silly looking, however, making him one of many weak villains in the MCU. **3.25/5**"
r96sk,"I had a great time with this, it narrowly surpasses <em>'Iron Man'</em> for me.

<em>'Captain America: The First Avenger'</em> is thoroughly entertaining. I absolutely enjoyed the story and how it is told, while the 1940s style is done fantastically - love the settings and costumes. The only negative I have is about the body double effect of skinny Captain America - which looks, honestly, ridiculous... in an amusing way, at least.

This is, possibly, the most I've enjoyed the overall cast for an MCU film so far. Chris Evans is fun to watch in the lead role, he does a grand job. Behind him, the likes of Tommy Lee Jones, Hayley Atwell and Hugo Weaving are enjoyable too.

A very pleasant experience, this. Good fun."

The World is Not Enough is directed by Michael Apted and adapted to screenplay by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Bruce Feirstein, using characters created by Ian Fleming. Music is scored by David Arnold and cinematography by Adrian Biddle. 

Bond 19 and 007 is required to protect a female oil magnate from potential assassination, but it soon becomes apparent that something far bigger and sinister is around the corner. 

Pierce Brosnan returns for his third turn as super suave secret agent James Bond and all the crucial elements for the franchise are firmly in place. From the exhilarating pre-credit sequence down the river Thames (14 minutes worth) to the glorious over the top explosive finale, this is a Bond film for those that enjoy the cheeky action led mania over thought and depth. Into the Bondian mix are the usual stalwarts; Judi Dench as M, Samantha Bond as Moneypenny, Desmond Llewelyn as Q (bidding a sad farewell to the franchise with a poignant moment) and Robbie Coltrane joyously returns as Zukovsky. Bond girl duties fall to Sophie Marceau (beautiful and solid) and Denise Richards (sexy, elfin like, but out of her depth) and the psycho for hire role lands at the considerably fine feet of Robert Carlyle, even if the latter is badly underused. 

The World Is Not Enough (the Bond family motto) is a whizz bang entry in the series and finds Brosnan well settled in the role; nailing the multitude of traits that make Bond a man that women want to bed and a man that men want to be. Locales are lovely and interesting (Turkey, France, Spain, Azerbaijan), the plot carries some intelligence (with a decent mystery element for a change), characterisations are high end and Arnold's score is a safe accompaniment; as is the title song by Garbage. It is, however, all too aware of wanting to appease Bond fans across the spectrum. Thus the comedy moments come off as saggy and the more scientific aspects (as gloriously ridiculous as they are) feel more like auto-pilot plotting. Still, you get what you pay for with 90s Bond, and the action sequences are terrific. After the mixed Tomorrow Never Dies the makers were clearly intent on taking the fans on a ripper of a ride, and no doubt about it, they achieve that in spades; with the two hour running time just flying by. 

Eon of course would take things one step too far three years later with the nadir that was Die Another Day, thus making this the last good Bond film before Daniel Craig's fabulous re-invention arrived in 2006. 7/10"
Wuchak,"_**The oil pipeline in central Asia episode**_

After a British oil tycoon is assassinated, agent 007 (Pierce Brosnan) traces the hit to a crazy ex-KGB terrorist (Robert Carlyle) and travels to the Caspian Sea/Black Sea area to protect a sultry oil heiress, the daughter of the murdered mogul (Sophie Marceau). Denise Richards is on hand as a nuclear physicist working at a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan while Robbie Coltrane returns from “Goldeneye” (1995) as Valentin Zukovsky, the former KGB agent turned gangster.

“The World Is Not Enough” (1999) is Brosnan’s third installment in the series with the opening featuring an absurd-but-fun boat chase on the River Thames in London and a great title song performed by Shirley Manson & Garbage. Other highlights include a paraglider-snowmobile assault in the snowy mountains, underground mayhem at the ICBM base in Kazakhstan, a wild sequence inside a pipeline to deactivate a bomb and a thrilling climax in the Bosphorus strait near Istanbul. 

Many complain about Denise Richards as the nuclear physicist, Dr. Christmas Jones, but she does a fine job and looks great, especially in those short shorts at the ICBM base in the high desert. Meanwhile Sophie Marceau as Elektra King is alluring in a classy way. Also on hand in the feminine department are Maria Grazia Cucinotta as the opening femme fatale, Serena Scott Thomas as Dr. Molly Warmflash and Samantha Bond as Moneypenny. Judi Dench of course returns as ‘M.’

This is a competent Bond flick with all the requisite staples; it’s just kinda unmemorable in the grand scheme of the franchise. Like the previous “Tomorrow Never Dies” (1997), the colors are muted, which casts a grey pall over the proceedings, although not as pronounced. 

The film runs 2 hours, 8 minutes, and was shot in Bilbao, Vizcaya, País Vasco, Spain (opening scene); London, England, & areas nearby; Baku, Azerbaijan, & the Azerbaijan Oil Rocks; Chamonix, Haute-Savoie, France (ski scenes); Bosphorus River, Istanbul, Turkey; and Eilean Donan Castle, Scotland (new MI6 headquarters).

GRADE: B-"
CinemaSerf,"I am afraid I struggled with this film right from the get-go. Not that Pierce Brosnan doesn't turn in a decent enough effort as ""007"", it's the supporting cast that are pretty average and the story - it is just so weak. Arch-baddie ""Renard"" (Robert Carlyle) has been shot in the head so gets stronger every day until he dies (any physicians please explain how a bullet near your brain can make you nigh-on immortal?). Robbie Coltrane is ordinarily excellent as a comic actor, but somehow his performance here as Russian hard-man ""Zukovsky"" is the wrong kind of funny and we see way too much of ""M"" (Dame Judi Dench) and the woefully cast John Cleese as ""R"" - luckily because Desmond Llewellyn was still round to amiably, and briefly, fill the role of gadget master ""Q"". To her credit, Sophie Marceau tries hard in the spirit of the old ""Bond"" girl role, delivering a feisty and adequate performance that is sexy but also pretty potent, too, as she tries to get to the bottom of who killed her industrialist father and is now trying to hijack her oil pipeline through some pretty lawless terrain. That plot, though, lurches from the silly to the ridiculous before an ending that took for ever to deliver what we all knew was bound to happen. There is plenty of action, car chases and pyrotechnics but sadly, the characterisations are what makes the ""Bond"" franchise stand out. Here they needed much better writing and a stronger hand at the tiller than was delivered by Michael Apted."
JPV852,"Love Brosnan as Bond but man was he straddled with a bad script and even worse casting with Denise Richards playing a nuclear scientist. I get pre-Craig Bonds always had a tongue-in-cheek streak to them and ridiculous scenes (the opening boat chase was laughable once it went to the street) but this was a bridge too far (only to be outdone in a scene in Die Another Day). That said, there are some decent action set pieces and Brosnan still has the charm. **3.0/5**"
mooney240,"**One of my favorite Bond films with surprising villains, more profound character development, great action, and a fitting farewell to a beloved character.**

The World Is Not Enough's massive box office success resulted from its excellent villains, beautiful filming locations, great characters, and endearing send-off of Desmond Llewelyn. This Bond film surprised with a masterminding, manipulative, and powerful female antagonist (the first in the Bond franchise since From Russia with Love in 1963). Sophie Marceau's portrayal of Electra King was innocent and vulnerable while cunning and ruthless - one of the best Bond villains of the last 30 years. The World Is Not Enough develops its female characters much more than a typical Bond movie by spending time exploring Elektra's complex character and introducing a confident, guarded, and beautiful nuclear physicist, Christmas Jones. Denise Richards' Dr. Jones isn't a helpless damsel but partners with Bond to stop catastrophe rather than immediately falling for his charms. Pierce Brosnan returned to his iconic role balancing his suave charm with icy brutality. Without a doubt, Brosnan is my favorite Bond. The action stands out as one of the best action offerings of the 1990s, and the pacing keeps the movie thrilling and engaging. The World Is Not Enough is a great Bond film with an exceptional villain and a friendly farewell to a series great."
John Chard,"For England, for home, and for the prize!  

Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is directed by Peter Weir, it stars Russell Crowe as Jack Aubrey and Paul Bettany as Stephen Maturin. It is spliced from various novels in the Aubrey–Maturin series written by Patrick O'Brian. The film takes place during 1805, during the Napoleonic Wars and finds Captain Jack Aubrey and the crew of British frigate HMS Surprise ordered to intercept, destroy or take as a prize the French privateer Acheron. But the Acheron (The Phantom as the crew of the Surprise call her) is no ordinary ship, and her Captain is smart. So Lucky Jack has his work cut out; not only in the pursuit of the Acheron, but in harmonising the crew under his command. Especially his loyal and trusting friend Stephen.

It's pretty evident within the first few minutes of Master & Commander that this is no standard blockbusting naval based war movie. If you are after, or was expecting, a wave to wave Bruckheimer carnage a-like piece, well you best, or should have, stay(ed) away. For this is a Peter Weir movie, in fact this is a Peter Weir ""period"" movie, where attention to details and character dynamics are the order of the day. There's battle action here for sure, beginning and end, and terrific they are too, as first cannonballs crack and splinter their targets (note the sound work here), and later as blade meets blade - it's exhilarating stuff alright. However, this is more interested in palpable tension, both on deck and on the waves. Threat is never far away, again, this is is covered by the impending duel with the Acheron and Aubrey's tactical pursuit/escape of her. As the Aubrey machinations unfurl, the crew give us a series of character dramas to involve us in the make up of a man-o-war's personnel. How different classes and males (there's not one female in the film) of all ages have to work together as one efficient unit in order to survive and triumph. Except for an interlude spent on the lusciously filmed Galapagos Island (Russell Boyd Best Cinematography Academy Award Winner), the film is set 99% of the time out at sea, on a cramped ship, this tells you that Weir is interested in telling a character driven story, one that is cloaked in realism above all else.

The teaming of Weir with the highly rated O'Brian material looked a good one, and to someone like me who has never read an O'Brian novel, it is. Unsurprisingly many of O'Brian's fans have been upset by either the stuff missing in the film, the stuff put in to fully form Weir's vision of the characters, or for Crowe not being Pugwashy enough. These complaints were inevitable since they come with practically every adaptation of novels these days. It should be noted, though, that Weir was very much a fan of O'Brian, and in fact always felt inspired by the tight intricate detail of his writings. What of the author himself? Well he passed away three years before the film was released, but he had always envisaged Charlton Heston for the role of Aubrey. So, who in the modern era comes closest to Heston's physical presence on screen, why Russell Crowe of course. Who not only brings that to the character, but also depth, because Aubrey comes with many traits. Strength, honour, stubbornness, leadership and loyalty are a given for a Captain on the high seas. Yet Aubrey is also vulnerable, self aware, playful, knows his limitations and is able to laugh at himself. Crowe peels off each layer and delivers a high quality performance - from our first encounter with Crowe as Aubrey, the realism so loved by Weir is given a shot in the arm - and it stays throughout the movie.

So an excellent piece of casting then, as is that of Paul Bettany as ships surgeon, science and nature lover, and best pal of the Captain, Stephen Maturin. Bettany and Crowe had formed a friendship on 2001's A Beautiful Mind, where their on screen chemistry lifted an already fine film, to an even better one. So it be here also. Stephen & Jack's relationship is the core of the piece, two very different men yet as tight as two peas in a pod, with Stephen serving as the code breaker for the audience as sea talk and tactical intrigue weaves in and out of the story. It's there where Bettany excels, for he not only has us believing in this warm (platonic) friendship, he's also got us rooting for him since he is in essence the odd man out on this ship. Our sympathy is firmly with him, our friendly rebel if you please. Of the rest there's note worthy turns from Billy Boyd, James D'Arcy & Edward Woodall, while Lee Ingleby gives a really heartfelt and emotionally engaging turn as the haunted Hollom.

The film is not without flaws, though. The pace of the piece does slip from time to time, while the talky middle section may stretch the patience of some, and the film isn't long enough to give the main characters some back story for the audience to work off. Yet it's still a terrific movie, ripe with intelligence and interesting characterisations, and boasting enough adrenalin, humour and upset to fill out a big budgeted 1950s historical epic. So get on board folks, for this is quality film making and it demands to be seen via the best format available. 9/10"
Peter McGinn,"This is a rousing sea yarn with great camera work, but it also shows comraderie and relationships in a realistic way on board a British fighting ship.

As happens sometimes but not always, I enjoyed this movie more than I liked the book it was based upon. O'Brian has written a lot of great sea tales, but this one confused me. I felt like checking to see if the pages were in the correct order. The story seems simplified in this adaptation. (Some may say that is not a good thing!)

The first several minutes of the film move the viewer around the ship, and I felt like It was a realistic representation of what it was like to sail on it. The creaking and other ever-present noises, the tight spaces allotted to the crew, all helped me feel like I knew what it was like more than just reading about it.

There are a lot of characters aboard ship, so out of necessity some of them never really developed, but even the glimpses we get of them here and there illustrate that they are people, not stereotypes. There were a few rather unlikely plot turns later on in the film, but by then I was drawn into the story and right there with the crew, so I forgave them.  I have watched Master and Commander twice so far, and wouldn't be averse to seeing it again."
r96sk,"I enjoyed <em>'Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World'</em>.

The early scenes are surprisingly (given the relatively close release dates) similar to fellow 2003 release <em>'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'</em>, with a hidden enemy ship spotted amid foggy conditions and then one person spots unexpected cannon fire and tells others to duck... there are even main characters named Jack (lead!) and Will!

With those amusing (to me, given that POTC is my favourite film) connections noted, the film goes on, of course, to do it's own thing and I'd say it comes out very nicely. The constant (supremely shot) action is a major plus, as are the performances of Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany. I coulda done with more characterization for those behind Crowe and Bettany as I didn't overly care for them, though the support cast are all solid to be fair."
ohlalipop,I liked the first movie better than this one. The songs were better too. Eric was really cute but I guess I'm just too biased for not liking him because of how he was with Mumble.
r96sk,"Who would've predicted that Brad Pitt and Matt Damon would be the stars of a <em>'Happy Feet'</em> sequel?!

Those two are the only real positives of <em>'Happy Feet Two'</em>. It's a better film than the original, so it deserves credit for that. However, both productions are just super uninteresting to me. The plot to this one is an improvement, even if it doesn't massively change it up. I do like, as in the first film, how the real life humans are merged in with the animation though.

Pitt (Will the Krill) and Damon (Bill the Krill) are the only ones who stand out, even if their characters are entirely pointless - they are basically this series' Scrat (<em>'Ice Age'</em>). Robin Williams and Hank Azaria are good too, here.

It is all very forgettable though, even if it does emulate the 2006 production."
Gimly,"**A long form review originally posted in 2011:**

Dubbed as a “re-quel”, _The Incredible Hulk_ was first released in 2008, and now, I’m here to review it in the line of Marvel films I’m getting through a the moment. 

I always like to think of films individually, but with the Marvel Cinematic Universe getting so big, that can be rather difficult to do. So though I may comment on films in relation to their sequels, remakes, prequels, spin-offs, parodies and the like, know that my final score out of ten is always based purely on the films merits, or lack thereof. 

It’s pretty crazy seeing Edward Norton (_American History X, Fight Club, Red Dragon, Kingdom of Heaven, Pride and Glory, Stone_) as a very scrawny Bruce Banner, considering that he turns into the giant, muscular Hulk. But to me it totally worked. As an interesting side-note, Norton co-wrote the script, which may or may not have contributed to his being ousted as Banner for any future films after the movie was released. Not because the script is particularly awful or anything, but because as a general rule production doesn’t like actors getting all up in ""dey grillz"" half way through. Although it’s not like Norton’s never done this sort of thing before.

Under-appreciated Tim Roth (_Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Planet of the Apes, Lie to Me, Rob Roy_) is also excellent (as far as I’m concerned) playing the role of Abomination/Emil Blonsky. Interesting side-note, no, he’s not related to Eli Roth, who’s also a friend and actor of Quentin Tarantino and his films.

Ultimately, _The Incredible Hulk_ is a fine film, but it just can’t stand up to the superior writing and character building of Thor, Iron Man or Iron Man 2. Liv Tyler (_The Strangers, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Armageddon_) is rather a non-event as supposed love interest Betty Ross. And William Hurt (_Robin Hood, A History of Violence, The Village, A.I.: Artificial Intelligence, Dark City_) as semi-antagonist General Thunderbolt Ross, is nothing but annoying (although it is pretty cool to see just how much they got him looking like the comic book character he is based on.

You would’ve thought that having a modern day Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde story to run with, backing from the success of the franchise you’ve got supporting you, that it would be easy to write strong characters, unfortunately, it’s not the case. And while the action sequences are cool, and the fighting is possibly some of the best that Marvel’s come up with, it’s not enough to bring this film up to the standards of the other 3. The film lacks the flair I’m sure everyone would be expecting, and while it’s a perfectly good monster-movie movie, perhaps a completely separate Super Hero origin story would have been better than the overly-CGI-ridden quasi-sequel to 2003’s _The Hulk_ that we ended up with.

tmdb44006625,"It's an improvement on the Ang Lee film only in the sense that the smashy smashy bits are more entertaining than the previous film's thinky thinky bits. But the fact that the entire film is just one long extended fight scene is disappointing to us who enjoy the darker, more emotional beats of the Hulk's story. I enjoy this movie quite a bit as a well put together piece of fluff entertainment, but I hold no delusions that even Marvel Studios couldn't get the definitive version of Hulk on screen."
r96sk,"Much more enjoyable than the 2003 film, which this 2008 release reboots. So that's a positive. As for a follow-up in the MCU, it's a little underwhelming if still passably good - at least to me.

<em>'The Incredible Hulk'</em> is closer to being forgettable than it is to being memorable, but that's not to say I didn't have a solid time watching. It's only really the ending that I felt dragged, yet even then it still has positive moments.

I liked Edward Norton's performance for the most part, particularly early on in South America. Tim Roth is good too, though a few of his scenes irritated me slightly - perhaps more to do with how the film uses him, rather than what Roth does himself. There are a few others, but those two are the most standout.

I did expect more, but there's enough there that I rate."

Reno,"**Little Sophie's giant adventure.**

I did not dislike it, but I thought it was not creative enough. I had seen the British animation and this one retained the same story. Of course, which was originally from the book, but nothing new other than a decent computer graphics. I liked the performance of the little girl who had played the Sophie. She was the only live character until the final stage where more joins her. So she was wonderful along with Mark Rylance's CGI role.

Straight to the point, the adventure begins right away. Sophie, the ten year old orphan girl was snatched by a giant named BFG after she witnessed him wandering on the street through her dorm room window on one midnight. Fearing she might expose the giant's existence, so he had to take her with him to his country. Then there they become very close, but a new threat arises when the other giants suspect of a human's existence in their enclosure. So fighting them, followed by a permanent solution to menace caused by them is what narrated in the rest.

It was like Peter Jackson's 'The Lovely Bones' for Steven Spielberg, I mean the films that did not work for them. I anticipated a major surge in this by the family film specialist Spielber. Because I usually love his film, tell me who won't. From children to adults, his films targets all ages. But if you had seen the old version, then you will lose half the interest. That's definitely won't be the same for the kids, they will love it. There's no harm for watching it once, so go for it.

_6/10_"
Gimly,"The animated '89 version of _The BFG_ was a staple of my youth, so naturally I was excited for a Steven Spielberg redo. Unfortunately, I don't think the tale lends itself well to the live action format. That, or the hands making this piece were unable to concentrate the narrative to where it went. In either case, the end product is a film with many tiny endearing moments of nostalgia that at no point come together to create a laudable whole.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
rahuliam,"The Revenant, a ravishingly violent Western survival yarn from Alejandro González Iñárritu, has a healthy few, scattered like acorns across its two-and-a-half-hour canvas..... no matter how extended, the film’s tense story is under the director’s complete control...DiCaprio’s performance is an astonishing testament to his commitment to a role. cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki done a great job..as a supporting actor tom hardy is brilliant..must watch..."
jamilammar,I thought this was a great movie. Seemed like it was a very physically demanding role for Leo.
Andres Gomez,"Good performances by DiCaprio and, even more, Hardy.

Good directing, specially the initial attack, photography, landscapes and soundtrack but the story is, at some points, unnecessarily violent and the action scenes are, sometimes, somehow stupid; people letting others to kill them, or ignoring foes close by ...

A good movie all in all, but not one of the greatests."
Reno,"> The one who came back from the dead to avenge.

The movie was inspired by the real event that sets in the year 1823, United States. When one of the crew members of the hunters left behind after he was severely hurt from a bear attack, he desperately looks for a way to get back to the camp alive, especially to avenge for the death of his close one. The whole film was about survival in the wilderness and to avoid the native Americans. But the introduction in the opening was very brief and in the final act, it was another brief man hunt. Overall, it was an enjoyable movie for adults with some gruesome scenes.

The movie was made on a grand scale. Well written screenplay, good direction, the cast, music and the locations, but it would have been even awesome if it was true to the original occurrence. I felt it was cinematically overdosed, especially for the commercial purpose. The fans of Leonardo Dicaprio's overwhelming celebration created a huge buzz. In fact, it looks like the entire Hollywood is his fan and the Oscars given to him out of sympathy, because I have seen his best performances better than this in the past.

The length of the movie was a big concern, should have been at least 15 minutes shorter. But the visuals were fantastic, the CGI bear was almost flawless. There are plenty of reasons why this should not be missed, at a time the narration lacks the realism. Otherwise, it would have made a wonderful semi-documentary film. So don't have high hope on this, especially if you're no ones fans, but just love watching movies like me. A little bit overrated everywhere, but still this movie is good, just good, that's it, not a masterpiece.

mattwilde123,"This is the best film I have seen all year (since 'Birdman', in fact, the previous film by Innaritu). It was expertly directed. The use of natural light really adds to the danger of the environment that surrounds Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio). Innaritu loves the camera to pan around objects and people to create a sense of awe and spectacle.

Leonardo DiCaprio really did deserve all the awards that he got for this role. I thought it was his best film by far. The realism and intensity of his performance really comes through.

The story was gripping throughout the whole film and I found the twists and turns very interesting.

★★★★½"
Gimly,"**The following is a long form review that I originally wrote in 2015.**

From a technical point of view, _The Revenant_ is one of the most masterful pieces of cinema I've ever seen. This made its one technical failure all the more jarring. The ADR. I don't know how or why this was allowed to happen, but the dubbing of the Native Americans is some 70's style shit, it's awful, and it's awful every single time. In your average film this would be only a minor annoyance, but in _The Revenant_ which A) pretty much nails everything else in the AV department, and B) Takes itself so goddamn seriously, this issue is painfully distracting.

I also found myself continuously rooting for the antagonists (first the bear, and later Hardy) subconsciously, and scolding myself for it. The good aspect of this is that it was rooted in the fact that all the characters are humanised (even the bear) and fallible, which I like, but the flip-side to that is I was less sympathetic to Leo's character, which takes up the majority of the screen time, and thusly I did not feel fully engaged for a large portion of the movie.

In fact the whole second and third acts underwhelmed me in that exact way. That's not to say that they were bad, but they were invariably weaker than the first act. After its end the rest of the film did feel like it was stretched a mite thin.

That all said, I knew within about 90 seconds that I was going to give _The Revenant_ a favourable review. Visually, it has this ethereal effect. It feels **too** real. So real that it must be a trick, the world of _The Revenant_ is alien in its realness. A bizarre contradictory nature that struck a chord with me immediately. For the average cinema-goer, I would say _The Revenant_ is worth your time, but for a movie aficionado or film student, I would say _The Revenant_ isn't anything short of a must.

Matthew Brady,"""My heart bleeds. But revenge is in the creator's hands"".

The Revenant is set in the 1820s, in the uncharted wilderness of America, Hugh Glass set out with a hunting party on an expedition. Glass was mauled by a bear and left for dead but through sheer will and to get back to his family, Glass survived - but that wasn't the only thing on his mind as he set out to payback the men who left him behind.

I remember last year around January time when I saw the two images for The Revenant, with Leo holding a Kentucky Flintlock Rifle looking like he's not playing around. Those two images straight away caught my interest. I then found out it was directed by the magnificent Alejandro González Iñárritu who did the Oscar wining ""Birdman"" (a movie that I personally loved). The Revenant quickly became my most anticipated movie of 2015, as I was looking forward to this movie more than Star Wars, and yes I said it. And after finally seeing the movie myself, I can safely say that I was not disappointed. The Revenant is one of the most stunning, brutal, intense, grizzly movie experience I've ever had. The movie isn't for everyone, but I loved it.

Alejandro González Iñárritu is starting to become my 3rd favorite director working today, because he's such an old school director when it comes to storytelling by the use of art. There's been a lot of drama happening behind the scenes of this movie, with the weather stopping the production or if someone made a mistake while filming, the crew must stop for the day and wait until tomorrow, because one mistake could lose a lot of day light for a scene (It was shot in natural lighting). One of the studios suggested that the movie should be shot using computer generated to make things much easier, but luckily Iñárritu said no to the idea by stating, ""If we ended up in greenscreen with coffee and everybody having a good time, everybody will be happy, but most likely the film would be a piece of shit."" And after seeing the movie I gotta say that it was the perfect decision, because it's very rare for a director today to take that risk and avoid what the studio says. Yes there are some CGI scenes, but the way that the animated effect's blended together with the practical effect's is handled incredibly well. This is one of the best directed movies I've seen in 2015 and I know Iñárritu already won an Oscar already, but I hope he wins another one for this, because never before have I seen a revenge tale presented so unique and utterly magnificent.

I respect Leonardo DiCaprio as an actor, but in this movie, he sleeps inside of a dead horse naked and eats raw food from animals, now if this doesn't get him an Oscar, nothing will. He's performance in this movie is what a call 'a silent performance', because Leo barley has that much lines in the movie and the only time he dose get to talk is in a different language (which Leo has said it was tricky to learn the language). DiCaprio has proven time and time again that he's more than a pretty face, but in this movie I only saw Hugh Glass, not DiCaprio. That's my biggest praise I have to give to Leo, as he had to deliver all the emotions, the pain and the tortured soul that Hugh Glass. All of that was all through his face and eyes and trust me when I say this, but it's not easy as you think. We are so use to seeing Leo as the angry, pretty boy billionaire in every movie he's in, but in this movie I thought he was fantastic. He played the man who lost everything. With very little lines he had, he still manages to make a powerful performance that's so far his best. I really hope Leo gets an Oscar for this.

Tom Hardy also gave an Oscar worthy performance in this movie. I've heard that some people had trouble understanding him in this movie (or just in everything that he's in really). Sometimes I didn't understand what he said but for the most part I did. But all that a side, I still think he was fantastic in the movie. He really added a lot to his character, because sometimes you understand the things that he dose in movie and yes the things he dose in the movie are wrong, but in a rough environment that these people are in, you would likely do the same. I'm not sure if he would get in for best supporting actor, but I hope he dose.

I'm running out of things to say about Emmanuel Lubezki breathtaking cinematography. The camera work and how he makes the camera feel like a character of it's own is seriously impressive. Lubezki captures nature on film, that shows it's beauty and it's unpredictable surprises. The people running the Oscars should just give Lubezki his third Oscar right now, because he's going to take that third trophy home.

For flaws I had with the film it that some of the character logic towards the end of the movie didn't make that much senses to me. And that's it.

Overall rating: ""The Revenant"" is one of most intense and stunning movies I've seen in 2015. The score is haunting, the editing was top notch and that bear attack scene was just terrifying. I mean how the hell did they do that? I don't know about you, but I honestly can't stop thinking about this movie. It's one of those movies that sticks with you after it's over and it isn't going away anytime soon."
r96sk,"Utterly riveting.

It's no surprise this one got/gets rave reviews - it's outstanding! <em>'The Revenant'</em> isn't necessarily edge-of-your-seat viewing, though it's still a massively impactful watch as you feel every hit of Hugh Glass' journey. It's rather gruesome and bloody, while it also has a few top notch action sequences.

Leonardo DiCaprio is easily one of my favourite actors of all-time, the man is simply a sensational actor - I'm yet to see an anything less than tremendous film involving him. I wouldn't even say this is his greatest performance, and that's saying something as DiCaprio is absolutely superb here.

Away from the main man, Tom Hardy is also part of this film. He is great, as I always expect from him. He and DiCaprio are fantastic actors. Hardy portrays John Fitzgerald, brilliantly. However, his character isn't written perfectly - not poorly by any stretch, he's just a bit flip-floppy at the beginning. The way the story creates itself involving Fitzgerald being where he is isn't as amazing as it could've been - very minor criticism, mind.

Another small complaint is the ending, there's nothing truly wrong with it at all but I, personally, would've concluded things about 10-15 minutes prior - there's a quality, almost Quentin Tarantino-esque, scene involving horses that would've made for a more thrilling end shot.

To finish, everything's beautifully crafted together visually, from a filmmaker's viewpoint, too. A marvellous film no doubt, certainly a must-watch!"
ohlalipop,"Honestly, I wasn't excited to see this film. I know I'll just catch this in dvd. But since there's nothing to do and it's my birthday and Mayi will treat me, okay!

The animation was great. I really liked the animation. The story was alright too. But the pacing of the story was slow that I was close to snoozing off. I felt like there were some scenes in the movie that should've been cut off."
DoryDarko,"'Rango' is typically one of those movies that can't quite be categorized into this or that little genre of comedy. Obviously, it's an animated film. Is it a kiddie movie? Well… kind of. Allow me to elaborate. The film starts off absolutely hilariously, with an accident, half a road kill and a journey through the desert turned into a maniacal chase as soon as a hungry hawk gets wind of Rango's presence. After meeting a lovely lizard named Beans, he ends up in the small town of Dirt. Where, after a good deal of bluff and dumb luck, he is appointed sheriff. So far, no harm, no foul, just good comedy. In fact, nearly-wetting-my-pants-laughing-out-loud-comedy.

However, at this point is where it all turns just a little bit haywire. No real damage done, just a small sense of cluelessness as we go along. The story continues as though Gore Verbinski and John Logan were just trying to think of as many weird situations as they possibly could whilst forcibly trying to mash it up into one, cohesive storyline. Truth be told, seems like they were trying just a little bit too hard. It actually gets even a little bit boring here and there, where the pacing kind of sinks in up to the point where it all comes together and starts to make sense again. (Mind you – this could also be due to the fact that I was watching the extended version, not the theatrical one, but still.) But fear not, no real quality is lost, as 'Rango' provides some of the most excellent and funny characters I've ever seen in an animated movie. They also rounded up a perfect voice-cast, with Johnny Depp who doesn't sound anything like Jack Sparrow, but still adds the same kind of awkward quirkiness to his character. Alfred Molina's part is small but vital, and I'll bet you've never heard an armadillo with a perfect Mexican twang before… Bill Nighy is awesome as Rattlesnake Jake, and you can even hear a little bit of Davy Jones coming through sometimes. One of the best parts however, is done by Ray Winstone as Bad Bill. Who would expect some Wild West bad guy to have a cockney accent? Brilliant.

Another thing I must mention is the superb animation. Without a doubt the best I've ever seen from a non-Pixar production. Heck, even if it was Pixar it would have been their absolute best so far, and that's saying something. The animation parallels – or, dare I say, even surpasses – Finding Nemo. That's right; I said it, so sue me. Yep, Industrial Lights & Magic made a fan out of me.

Now, back to the original question – is it a kiddie movie? Yes and no. Some parts are totally hilarious and will have your youngsters rolling over the floor with laughter. Other parts will sail right over their little heads as they are very much grown-up humour with references to classic films and jokes they simply won't get. (Is it just me or did I catch a tiny reference to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas in the beginning?) Another factor is that some of the humour is a little grim and quite mature for small children, with some of the creatures smoking, swearing and even getting shot and/or killed. Now, personally I don't know any children who would be upset by any of this, they see things that are much worse on a daily basis on the Disney channel. But then again, I'm not American, and it is my understanding that some American parents are hugely bothered by some of the elements in this movie. So I would recommend that you simply watch it first and then decide if you would like your children to see it. But honestly, I would try not to be too sensitive about it, it doesn't get scary anywhere and none of language or behaviour is really that bad. 

All in all, 'Rango' is definitely a fun ride, and one of the few animated movies that will entertain as many adults as it will children.

Filipe Manuel Dias Neto,"**An enjoyable film that gives us, perhaps, more than we could have hoped for.**

This film surprised by not coming from any of the major animation studios and, even so, having a lot of quality and winning the Oscar for Best Animated Film. I didn't see it at the time, I just saw it now, but I can say that I was reasonably pleased. The film pays an honorable tribute to the old western movies with a narrative set in the present day, but in a small village in the Nevada desert, where the water has disappeared, causing fear to all the residents, who still live and behave as they did in the old days.

Of course, the characters are anthropomorphic animals, and the protagonist is an unnamed chameleon (mistakenly called lizard by everyone) who, already in the city, adopts the name of Rango, eventually being promoted sheriff. As such, he will have to deal with bandits, protect the already scarce water supplies and find out what happened to these supply. Overall, the story is quite satisfying and has its merits. The film is neither too childish nor overly tiring for adults, I felt there was enough material to appeal to a wide range of age groups.

Directed by Gore Verbinsky, the film has a very pleasant pace, despite being a little longer than most animated films, which almost never exceed 90 minutes. In addition to really beautiful and well-executed cinematography, with good lighting and good use of color, the film has the best digital animation, clearly evident in the details of the buildings, the characters and the environment in which they move. The issue of water, and its importance, was not wrongly thought either, and it seems increasingly relevant in the times we live in… you don't have to live in the desert to feel the lack of drinking water. The soundtrack also deserves a special mention for its relevance and quality, with melodies that alternate between epic, western and Latin-Mexican.

Finally, a note of appreciation for the quality of the voice actors and the work they did together: Johnny Depp works very well with his voice in the main character, and he still plays another character, in another vocal timbre. Isla Fisher, Abigail Breslin, Bill Nighy, Ned Beatty and Alfred Molina are all in great shape here."
vrabaci,"Highly recommended movie! Educational, funny both for children and adults."
JPV852,"Solid entry that should have been the conclusion to the Bourne character, instead Damon and Greengrass chased the dollar to return to ""Jason Bourne"" which I remember being underwhelmed by (will be revisiting it sometime during the week).

Still, some good chase and fight sequences though the great trailer line (""If you were in your office right now we'd be having this conversation face-to-face."") makes Bourne look like an arrogant a** because if he hadn't tipped off his location, he would've avoided the chase and made it to the E. 71st location having the element of surprise. In addition, the relationship between Bourne and Nicki (sp?) still felt off.

Anyway, still was entertained but probably rank this as the third best of the series (right now, going to revisit Legacy soon). **4.0/5**"
owen333,"I loved it it was so much fun and very funny, another marvel masterpiece"
Frank Ochieng,"When one thinks of a typical super-hero actioner, they imagine the boisterous boundaries that are associated with such an explosive genre: eye-popping special effects, outlandish and grand-standing villains, world domination escapades, complex yet flashy super-heroes that seem unreal and unapologetic and a big scale of unbelievable escapism that is tellingly becoming of a comic book epic on the big screen for the hungry eyes of the giddy moviegoer. Remember, all these described elements are not a bad thing when it comes to larger than life comic book/superhero fantasies. In fact, we almost insist that our volt-minded vehicles have some kinetic kick to its pulsating, pithy adventures. After all, there is certainly nothing wrong with that approach to the cinematic sensationalism of summertime popcorn pleasers and the costumed heroes that take us on that daring, rollicking ride of magical mayhem.

However, director Peyton Reed’s ‘Ant-Man’ symbolizes a different texture and tone to the familiar action-packed world of Marvel Comics’ outrageous universe both on the printed pages and in the dark movie theaters. It does not necessarily use the overwrought or ultra-stimulating tactics to sell its percolating product as a super-charged heroic fable of mighty manipulators out to save the planet in the tradition of frantic favorites such as ‘The Avengers’ film franchise for instance. Instead, ‘Ant-Man’ relies on its small and intimate take of quirkiness, introspection, a gentle doomsday message of despair and a measurement of an awkward man that wears his bugged-out wardrobe with a sense of curiosity and conviction. In essence, ‘Ant-Man’ is a costumed caper that is high-spirited in its low-key excitement…something quite refreshing and revered in the wild and wacky world of Marvel Comics’ representation of the super-studs and sasses that invade our cinematic sensibilities in the hazy days of summer.

‘Ant-Man’ lead Paul Rudd, an affable actor that has shown various levels of competence in both comedies and dramas over the years, is the unlikely source to don an ant-oriented attire and let his charm and cheekiness take over as the tiny bugged-eyed avenger of right and might. Rudd plays Scott Lang, a former troubled lawbreaker and gifted engineer whose demons come back to haunt him when he gets involved in the burglary shenanigans with his bad news buddies (T.I. and Michael Pena). The reason for Lang’s lure back to crime: a cockeyed but convenient way to win over the affections of his estranged young daughter.

Interestingly, another great analytical mind of mechanics and science in stand-offish Hank Pym (Oscar-winner Michael Douglas) is spotlighted as he too struggles to relate to his daughter as well in the pretty Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly). Anyhow, Pym has a colorful backstory as it is revealed that he used to save the world from harm as the underrated crime-fighter Ant-Man. There was no glory or special recognition for Pym’s heroics as the buggy super-hero but his devotion to his crime-stopping craft was realized nevertheless.

As ANT-MAN Paul Rudd's Scott Lang has plans to stop the criminnal foolishness besides raiding a giant-sized picnic basket in Peyton Reed's modest costume caper.
As ANT-MAN Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang has plans to stop the criminal foolishness besides raiding a giant-sized picnic basket in Peyton Reed’s modest costume caper.
The conflicted father-daughter tandem of Pym and Hope eventually recruit the beleaguered Lang to climb into the exo-skeletal red-and-black suit and become the current Ant-Man to continue the mission of promoting goodness over evil. In this specific case, Lang’s Ant-Man is asked to foil the nefarious agenda of Pym’s former protege and associate Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) who threatens to expose the revolutionary shrinking technology to anyone sinister that offers him an insane and immediate price for such secretive scientific information that could jeopardize mankind in the long run. Of course, it goes without saying, that Cross has an ominous alter-ego in the vile Yellowjacket whose back-and-forth clashing with Lang’s Ant-Man leads to the calculating and corrosive chess game of one skillful insidious insect trying to outwit and outmaneuver a conscientious one.

Some may dismiss ‘Ant-Man’ as being too low-grade, cheesy and incidental in its confrontational canvas of saints versus sinners. Still, Reed’s handling of his Marvel-inspired ‘battle of the bugs’ is a winning formula in simplicity because it does not have to be rooted in a spectacular and showy landscape as the other successful bombastic blockbusters that come out of the frivolous factory of Hollywood. Essentially, ‘Ant-Man’ demonstrates the right kind of personality and prestige for its presentation as a scaled-down comic book actioner steeped in the personalized disillusionment of the characterizations and their assorted psyches. Sure, ‘Ant-Man’ will not let anyone forget its popular competitor in the much glorified and iconic standing of another insect-fighting Marvel mastermind in ‘Spider-Ma’n anytime soon. Yet Scott Lang’s Ant-Man is just as angst-ridden, impish, awkward and devoted as Peter Parker’s resilient web-headed wonder Spidey.   

The drama unfolds so convincingly in ‘Ant-Man’ not so much because of the dire dilemma of comicbook goodness and badness but because of the examination of deteriorating relations between broken men and their families or more specifically between fathers and daughters. Both Rudd and Douglas are committed to their roles as the Ant-Men that saved the world with ease past and present but could not say the same thing about rescuing the domestic responsibilities that eluded them under their own roofs. As Lang tries to find an opening for forgiveness toward his little girl and remarried ex-wife (Judy Greer), his current adviser Pym struggles to put the pieces together with a disgruntled Hope that blames her father for the neglect of her well-being as well as the death of her beloved late mother known as the Wasp, a super-heroine that shined in her own shadow of accomplishment.

‘Ant-Man’ is a soulfully weird, witty sliced-down spectacle of a comicbook film that is rare in its skin to deliver the message of a connection not just to stamping out the cartoonish crime and chaos that is routinely found in the playful playground of Marvel’s movie machine of high-powered personalities armed with skillful brute and brilliance. It also has something called heart and hope as it tackles the alienation and isolation of fathers and their vulnerable daughters. It will take more than a gigantic can of Raid to destroy the indomitable presence of ‘Ant-Man’ and what his hedonistic heroics, both physical and psychological, bring to the prized picnic table.

John Chard,"The Pocket Rocket.

Given the production problems and its long gestation period, Ant-Man is arguably far better than it had right to be. Unsurprisingly with a Marvel Super Hero film, the critical reactions have been mixed, but given it's not as gargantuan as most Marvel pics it proves to have a big entertaining heart. A pic cunningly viewing the Marvel Universe from a different angle, whilst also not over egging the pudding.

The effects work is impressive, the origin story narrative engrossing and with it carrying a lightness of touch, and there's a very enjoyable cast enthusiastically buying into the comic book frivolity. Sure, some of it's just plain daft, our hero's powers are hardly blunderbuss stuff, while the family melodramas bubbling away feel tired, but come the glorious finale, pandering to the child in us all, it's another Marvel winner readying itself for further adventures of Ant-Man. 7.5/10"
Reno,"> Size doesn't matter if he's a superhero who committed to save the world.

My confession is I never read 'Ant-man' comics and I never knew such kind of superhero even exist in Marvel till this movie was announced. (But I know Danish film 'Antboy'.) So I'm glad they brought cinematic version of 'Ant-man' and I'm sure he'll return to the next 'Avengers' as they promoted strongly in this film itself to know what would be the audience response. I don't know others, but I definitely welcome the idea.

Another CGI magic, another Marvel's wonder. As long as they pick the right cast and crew with a good story, the sci-fi like this continues to rule the cinema world. It was a great team work, that must be appreciated. As usual the top notch visuals as well the performances, even the sidekicks. But I was surprised to see when Paul Rudd was attached to this project. I believed it would be a comedy sci-fi packed with full of action, and I was wrong. It was a simple tale, a heist theme and of course it was fun to watch, but never was a comedy movie.

A wonderful beginning, especially for the first film in the series. You know strong foundation is the key to raise a building above. I know the sequels would only get better by progressing and it should be. Because in all the Marvel's superhero flicks, this one was the most family and young kids friendly. That does not mean there were no violence, but from the title to the characters and presentation, all were so casual and can be understood by all.

It was so great to see a legend like Michael Douglas to be a part in the modern movie. Now I am eager to see Evangeline Lily as Wasp-girl in the follow-up. It would be like Peter Pan and Tinker Bell, but in a sci-fi version. The extras were very interesting, I enjoyed them as well. If you're are yet to see the film, don't expect anything like Disney's 'Honey' trilogy, after all, if you enjoy the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) then you would do same for it which is the twelfth to follow.

7.5/10"
mattwilde123,"I like Paul Rudd and was hoping this would be as funny as 'The Guardians of the Galaxy' but it wasn't. It looked good and the direction was solid but I think it suffered from the constant screenplay rewrites that the film underwent by changing the screenwriters (Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish).

I also felt it was a bit too long-winded and it was unbalanced. However, the main good feature in this film was the special effects.

★★★"
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"I have to say that I did not have great hopes for this movie. However, I found it surprisingly enjoyable. As can be expected from a Marvel super hero movie it is not the most intelligent plot around but instead rather heavy on special effects.

Having said that the plot is not bad given the context. I have never read any of the Ant-Man comics so I had no idea what to expect. The little expectation I had was of some guy turning into some ant like creature smashing things left right and center. So it was somewhat of a surprise to me when I found out that the guy was actually shrinking himself to ant size. Actually I went a bit “what the f…” when I first realized this and felt that this was going to be boring.

However, in the end, I felt it worked out quite well. If it would have just been about some guy shrinking himself then it would indeed have been somewhat boring but the added coolness of this guy being able to command armies of bad-ass ants really helped stave of the boredom.

As I wrote above it is a Marvel super hero movie so it is heavy on special effects and, personally, I felt they where quite okay. There is of course quite a bit of action in the movie as well as a bit of humour. I quite liked the parts where the Ant-Man and his nemesis slugged it out in a children’s room and a giant size Thomas the Tank Engine was thrown through the roof and into the garden. Maybe I liked it because Thomas the Tank Engine is a TV show that my kids liked to watch when they were smaller. There where of course a few of the usual Hollywood silly, brain-dead stunts like the tank scene. It could have been so cool but it was really ruined by the total lack of intelligence in the stunt following the cool revelation.

I really liked Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank Pym as well as Evangeline Lilly as Hope Van Dyne. I was not too impressed by Paul Rudd but on the while I guess he was not too bad. It is a bit of a shame though that when Hollywood feels they need to throw in a bit of family drama they always have to throw in a divorce. It is rather depressing for us that have lived through such a tragedy after all.

Bottom line, this was a surprisingly enjoyable movie. Far better than quite a few of the super hero movies that Marvel/Hollywood have produced like for instance the abysmal Spiderman movies although that is of course a personal opinion."
Gimly,"Less spectacle than most MCU films have been serving up, particularly in phase two, but the story and characterisation is actually a little stronger than the past couple of tales Marvel has served up.

Villain Darren Cross, AKA “Yellowjacket” (originally a hero in the comics) lacks the onscreen presence of top tier Marvel-evil Loki, but is certainly one of the stronger offerings the MCU has given us. His twisted relationship with his former mentor gives another level to this Marvel film not seen since _Winter Soldier_.

Not so much a super hero film as a super heist film, _Ant-Man_ was a welcome refreshment to the comic book movie party, and though I always like to give myself some time to find exactly where MCU films fit in my overall experience, at the moment I would say _Ant-Man_ sits somewhere comfortably in the middle, maybe even a bit below, but is still well worth a watch, even for those who aren’t deeply involved with the film series as a whole.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"
Wuchak,"***Ant-Man?***  

Released in 2015, ""Ant-Man"" stars Paul Rudd as Scott Lang, a cat burglar who is offered redemption and the opportunity to be a hero. Michael Douglas plays his mentor, Hank Pym, and Evangeline Lilly Pym's daughter; meanwhile Corey Stoll co-stars as the heavy.

In my vast arsenal of old comics I have only one issue where Ant-Man is the main star: Marvel Feature #10, which featured Hank Pym as the hero, not to mention his wife, the Wasp, AKA Janet van Dyne. The character's run in that comic ceased with that very issue. By the 80s Scott Lang, a good-intentioned thief, became Ant-Man after stealing Pym's Ant-Man suit to save his daughter. With the encouragement of Pym, Lang became Ant-Man full-time.

The movie is based on these events and I was surprised at how entertaining it is considering how relatively minor the hero is. The movie even makes a joke about this when Ant-Man comes face-to-face with the Falcon (Anthony Mackie). Speaking of which, it's great to see the Falcon in action. It's also great to see Yellowjacket who, in the comics, was Hank Pym after Lang took over as Ant-Man. In the movie Yellowjacket is the villain (Stoll), which is okay since Pym's Yellowjacket in the comics sort of became a villain when he had a mental breakdown and was eventually divorced by Janet, the Wasp. The filmmakers incidentally did an excellent job with the Yellowjacket suit.

""Ant-Man"" was a surprise hit at the box office and understandably so. It's a quality superhero flick done with style and brimming with confidence. It's nothing more than this, but that's all it needs to be. It's nice to see Michael Douglas who was, believe-it-or-not, 70 years-old during shooting. He shines in the movie as Pym and could easily pass for ten years younger. I also really liked the Quantum Realm sequence when Lang is reduced to microscopic size.

The film runs 117 minutes and was shot in Georgia and San Francisco, CA. ADDITIONAL CAST: Judy Greer, Bobby Cannavale and Michael Peña.

GRADE: B+/A-"
tmdb44006625,"Ant-Man is a much needed breath of fresh air from all the city-breaking, galaxy saving epicness of the past five Marvel movies. It's a nice, light, fun heist movie with some pretty cool effects and a great cast of characters.

Michael Pena, T.I. and David Dastmalchian make this movie so much more enjoyable. Not that Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, and Corey Still aren't great, but those three as a sidekick trio crack me up.

Edgar Wright's stamp is all over this movie and it's a shame his directorial touch is missing, because he would have known what to remove to make it even better.

But all in all, Ant-Man is great entertainment with a feel good story about a man trying to be the hero his kid thinks he is."
r96sk,"Much better than anticipated, I actually thoroughly enjoyed <em>'Ant-Man'</em>. The concept is silly, but I felt it made it work very well.

It starts off as more Paul Rudd-esque than Marvel-esque, especially with the comedy. I wasn't expecting much from it at that point, not that it was necessarily bad or anything but it wasn't what I'd expect from an MCU film. However, positively, it turns into something that fits in this universe.

I enjoyed the action, score and humour. The cast do good things, with Paul Rudd filling the titular role nicely. I also really enjoyed Michael Douglas. Evangeline Lilly and Michael Peña are pluses, too. Corey Stoll, meanwhile, is a little meh I will say - entirely passable, but nothing memorable.

This is a pleasant watch, one I'd recommend."
Cithü,Good :3
thomasdelgado,Awesome movie!
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"I still do not agree with the 9 and 10 star ratings but I feel this movie is slightly better than the first one. This is primarily because Jennifer Lawrence’s character is more mature and she seems more comfortable in the role. She is no longer an immature, naive and lost child. At least not most of the time.

The entire setup is still as ludicrous as before. It is a silly and depressing background scenario and it is definitely not my cup of tea. The people running around in ridiculous hair-do, makeup and showing a severe lack of intelligence is not making things better.

The enjoyment of this movie comes when the games finally start. These parts are definitely better than in the first movie. The various dangers are well done, the effects good and there is an interesting overall theme to the arena and the dangers instead of randomly throwing new menaces at players that seemed to be the strategy in the first movie.

To me the enjoyment of this movie is in the games themselves. This is probably because I just do not like the rest of the plot. The depressing scenario. The nonsensical and/or oppressive behavior, backstabbing etc. etc."
Andres Gomez,"More of the same stuff.

Lawrence is not bad and I think Josh Hutcherson is a great discovering but that's mostly it."
CharlesTheBold,"This is a sequel to 2012's HUNGER GAMES, and is set in the same future world: a post-apocalyptic world where an Empire, called Panem, has imposed peace on the survivors only to decay into brutal tyranny. The symbol of the tyranny is the Hunger Games, a gladiator-type combat where only one ""victor"" is permitted and the rest of the fighters die. To keep the flow of victims coming, 12 districts of Panem are required each year to supply a teenage boy and girl for the fight, ostensibly as punishment for decades-old rebellion.

The theme of this movie is the moral issues over how to oppose such tyranny. Katniss Everdeen ( Jennifer Lawrence), the spirited girl who won the previous year's Games, wishes to stop the oppression, but fears that outright revolution will hurt too many people. There is another character (whom I won't identify to avoid spoilers) who doesn't care how many people are hurt as long as the revolution is advanced. Many of the subjects of the Empire are resigned to submitting until some messianic deliverer will appear. Meanwhile the ruthless President-for-life Coriolanus Snow ( Donald Sutherland) is determined to destroy the rebels before they can get organized. Who will win out? Therein lies the suspense.

There are enough special effects to make the futuristic background and technology credible without overwhelming the movie.
Aside from Lawrence and Sutherland as the impressive antagonists, the movie has a strong supporting cast: Woody Harrelson as Katniss's shrewd but alcoholic mentor; Liam Hemworth and Josh Hutcherson as two boys representing the aggressive vs sensitive sides of Katniss's character; Elizabeth Banks as a kindly but naive woman oblivious to the tyranny; Oscar-winner Philip Hoffman as Snow's Machiavellian adviser, and Sam Clafin, Jeffrey Wright, and Jena Malone as formidable former victors drawn into the conflict.
The movie's only real flaw is that being part of a continuing story keeps the plot from being resolved in the end."
Kamurai,"Good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

This is a great survivalist story in a horrible setting (wonderfully set, written to be a horrible world).

We get all the great fun that we got from the original movie, and then we add in the whole (spoiler) element.  It's really what makes the movie and leads us into the next arc, but I won't mention it.

With Snow just on an angry tantrum spree (literally using childish tantrum words) you can tell very early that he's defeated himself, it's just a matter of time.

Jennifer Lawrence is a big enough personality to carry the movie and she does with everyone else playing support roles centered around her.  It was fantastic to see Jena Malone come on board as I feel she adds something special to everything she's in.

If you can stand the battle royale concept, this this is a good watch for you."
CinemaSerf,"Having survived the 74th Hunger Hames, ""Katniss"" (Jennifer Lawrence) and her on-screen beau ""Peeta"" (Josh Hutcherson) now expect to live a life of luxury in their victor's village - but nope, devious president ""Snow"" (Donald Sutherland) has other plans for them. Having dispensed with the services of poor old Wes Bentley, he brings in Philip Seymour Hoffman (""Plutarch"") to create a sort of Champions League affair with previous - supposedly forever exempt - winners to come back for a ""quell"". It's a good excuse to bring in some old blood two help out the youngsters - Jeffrey Wright (""Beetee"") probably most notable amongst them, and we pretty much repeat the perilous escapades of the first film. This time, though, the threads of an uprising and a more collaborative approach to resistance start to win through; we see our combatants start to use their heads more, to thwart the divisive aims of their president and the story starts to gain a bit more momentum. Sadly, though - pretty as they are; the acting is still really weak. Lawrence just doesn't engage with me and the new ""Finnick"" (Sam Claflin) character again offers eye candy a-plenty, but squashing a cutie into lycra doesn't make him any better an actor. To be fair, they don't have a great deal by way of decent dialogue to deliver as almost all of this is an exercise of advanced CGI. The ending does, at least, offer us promise that the third leg of this franchise will offer more scope to vary the theme a bit, but as far as this is concerned, it's nothing at all special."
Reno,"> A little girl and her unexpected adventure with an unlikely friend.

It was a good movie, but just like 'Turbo', it was turned down by the critics and so those who follow them. Besides Disney and Pixar, DreamWorks Animation ain't that bad at all. Technical side of this film comes under same league with the other two top production house, but the story and the character are not strong enough. Comedies were awesome, and so the dialogues, the innovation in narration falls short with the same old cliche in the alien theme. The soundtracks were good though, especially that one used for the promotion, 'feel the light'.

For a change, the lead girl character was different and voice rendered by Rihanna. I said it many times that my first ever 3D animation was 'Ants', despite 'Toy Story' was the first feature length. And this film has been the best work of the director to till date since his first flick 'Antz'. As usual like any animated movie, it was targeted for children, but I enjoyed watching it. There won't be a sequel at least for now, but I would love to have one. For a change you can try this to get a break from the fairytales and princess stories.

6.5/10"
furious_iz,"Utterly average film that was rightly overlooked by the critics. There is nothing much apart from pretty colours. Rihanna is not an actress, and when you can't see her pretty face you seriously notice that. I wouldn't bother with this one, there are leagues better out there."
Peter McGinn,"I enjoyed this entry into the HG Wells film library. The special effects are great (to this amateur anyway) and the acting and action more than adequate. Plus it stays near enough to the sci-fi genius of the author to satisfy the fans of the classic novel. I will say that I got a little tired of the son acting like such a teenager, but he and the Tom Cruise character both show some character growth by the end of the film. Tom is one of those actors who seems to be playing himself a lot, but I suspect there is a lot more work to it than that. I'm not sure Dustin Hoffman would have gotten his Academy Award for Rain Man if he had played off a lesser actor than Cruise. 

I think there are a couple of scenes the movie could have done without, such as in the cellar with Cruise, his daughter and the man who lived there. It slowed the story down, changed the tenor of the drama, and didn't add a lot, in my view. But it is what it is and overall I found War of the Worlds to be entertaining. Good science fiction movies can be hard to find."
JPV852,"First time seeing this in 15 years and lame plot, annoying characters (both kids got on my nerves) and a protagonist who just runs around, as Tom Cruise does so well, but has zero impact on the end game which was... bacteria. Yeah, this was just as dumb today as it was back then. At least the visual effects and sound design still holds up. **2.5/5**"
JPV852,"Entertaining action-thriller with Angelina Jolie doing a great job again (following Mr. & Mrs. Smith) as an action heroine. The stunts are pretty well done (but don't compare with those in the Bourne series). This didn't do too bad at the box office (close to $300M worldwide, $110M budget) but no sequel despite this, at least the version I watched (Director's Cut), being left open-ended. **3.75/5**"
CinemaSerf,"Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is a CIA operative who having recently been repatriated in a Korean prisoner swap, is back behind a desk looking forward to going home to her arachnologist husband. On her way out of the door, she and her boss ""Ted"" (Liev Schreiber) are diverted to deal with an hitherto unknown Russian who in the course of his interrogation names her as a Russian spy. Now we hit ""Bourne"" meets ""Lara Croft"" mode as she is determined to get back to her husband and to prove she is not an enemy agent before Chitiwel Ejiofor (""Peabody"") and his FBI buddies nail her slats to the mast. It's end to end action with lots of car chases, explosions, gun battles and the usual red herrings as she tries to hunt down the real bad guys. It is an action thriller, not a documentary - so don't expect Pulitzer standard writing nor for it to be especially plausible or to make much sense; it's just a good old take-over-the-world adventure movie with decent performances all round."
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"Let me make it clear from the beginning, I do not care if a movie like this is 100% true to the bible and I could not care less about the creationist fanatics moaning about how this and that movie is telling the wrong story or is distorting their religion. But this attempt to re-tell the story is just bad.

The first half of the movie is not all bad. It is actually somewhat enjoyable. The dark scenery is sometimes depressing and beautiful at the same time. I did like the watchers. It added a bit of extra to the movie and the fight when Tubal-Cain tried to capture the ark was not bad at all.

However, then it went downhill quickly with Noah going more and more nuts and Tubal-Cain, having survived, is subverting Noah’s son Ham. Not that Noah did not really bring that upon himself to some extent though. The parts where Noah want to kill his grandchildren and stops in the last minute is just Hollywood soap-opera bullshit. Also, do not get me started about the ridiculous scene where Anthony Hopkins goes berry hunting like some mental retard.

Up until about half the movie I did not really understand all the very negative reviews but after having watched through the miserable last half I have to say that I do understand them more. I think the one-star ones are a bit harsh since the movie is often quite beautiful and the acting, despite the crappy script, is quite good, but the lousy script is just destroying the movie.

Definitely a disappointment."
Grant English,"This is a hard movie to watch and rate.

The Good:  The images of the flood coming from both above and below the earth were spectacular. The trauma that Noah deals with during the flood and post-flood is beautifully depicted.  I loved the image of Noah realizing that the ‘sickness’ is in him as well as the others. The story-telling of creation to fall to the flood was beautifully done. I also liked the tension of Noah and the family on the ark as they wrestle with the possibility that the Creator has forgotten them. 

So with all that good, what ruins the movie?

I do think a director/writer has an obligation to the source material.  Subtract the religious aspect of this movie and imagine the outrage if someone changed the story of Harry Potter or Thor.  (Oh wait…they are doing that.)  

Point is: if you have source material, use it.  Go ahead and be creative when there are blanks to fill in but why have source material if you're not going to use it?  The director did merge two ancient flood stories – the Bible and the Babylonian Enuma Elish.  In the end – neither tradition gets a clear telling of their story.

Other issues?  The role of Methusala was a complete waste of the talented Anthony Hopkins.  And I still have no idea as to why he was even in the film.

The conclusion felt hollow and rushed.  Noah at the beginning of the film leads an isolationist lifestyle focused on raising his children to be good stewards of the earth.  How is this different at the end of the film?  It's not.  Their understanding of life, the Creator, the world isn't any different than the beginning.  There really isn't a pay off to the story...at all.

It's just an average film and I expected more with this cast."
JPRetana,"Watching Noah, it occurs to me that it must have been made by atheists. After all, they are treating the Word of God  as little more than a first draft. 

On the other hand, though, co-writer/director Darren Aronofsky isn’t fucking around with the old ""thou shalt not take the name of the Lord your God in vain,"" making sure to substitute the G word with the epithet ""the Creator."" 

Thus, Noah (Russell Crowe) tells his wife Naamah (Jennifer Connelly) that “[the Creator] is going to destroy the world” (after which he will presumably be known as “the Destroyer”) by way of a flood, which may have given rise to the expression 'when it rains it pours;' I mean, the characters are already living in a post-apocalyptic wasteland; destroying it would certainly qualify as overkill.

Noah turns to his grandfather Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins) for advice — by the way, according to the Bible, Noah invented wine, but what the Good Book doesn’t say is that Methuselah invented tea; the latter is a miracle in itself, since water and leaves, the two essential ingredients to prepare this beverage (not to mention the fuel needed to start a fire and the kindle to keep it burning), are entirely conspicuous by their absence. 

Luckily, Methuselah has a magical seed that can grow an entire forest overnight, but which he had apparently been saving to give to Noah. Noah uses the wood from the trees in this forest to build the Ark, which follows the Field of Dreams Principle; i.e., 'If you build it, they will come' — 'they' being two of each animal, all of which without exception clearly belong to the computatrum generatae genus, but then the visual effects are one of the few pleasures to be had here; in particular the “Watchers” (fallen angels turned into semi-anthropomorphic rock formations voiced by Frank Langella and Nick Nolte, among others), as well as the montage that accompanies Noah's narration of Genesis.

Additionally, the Ark itself and the accompanying flood are not unimpressive, and I like how Aronofsky has Noah's sons succumb to Rapid Aging Syndrome to indicate the passage of the many years it would take to complete such a gargantuan project.

The problem with this is that they grow up to be Emma Watson, Logan Lerman, Douglas Booth, etc., all of them with impossibly perfect hair, skin, and teeth (unless, of course, Methuselah also invented shampoo and toothpaste, in addition to tea).

All things considered, however, the real highlight of the film is Ray Winstone's performance as Tubalcaín. Winstone is nominally the villain, but his character is really the most sensible of all (and Winstone’s delivery lends eve more weight to his convictions), correctly pointing out that both the Creator and the proto-David Koresh that Crowe plays Noah as — although his madness is justifiable; ""if the noise of all those animals didn't drive Noah insane (not to mention the insect bites), the smell should have killed him"" (The Skeptic’s Dictionary) — have become drunk with power."
ohlalipop,"The animation was something else. It looked so real. I don't really remember the story from the comics (we had the entire collection when we were younger but lost all of it when we left the Philippines), but the story was really nice. I can't wait for the next one if ever there'll be a next one."
lmao7,"Wow…they just took cg/motion/performance capture to the next level! Just for the film’s look - like without the story, it deserves an A++

Not just the look (soo realistic especially the extras and the scenery) but the shots! There were a lot of street/chase scenes that was done beautifully. The clothes, the buildings…it was so perfect!

I liked the opening credits reminded me of Pink Panther & Catch Me If You Can but the opening scene, the painting of Tintin, was that Herge? so awesome!

Of course as expected there were some changes like the sequence of events but it worked well for me (maybe not the crane scene but it didn’t bother me that much) and I missed Professor Calculus, I thought it would include Red Rackham’s Treasure. Now I can’t wait for the next one, I want to see them all at Marlinspike Hall.

All in all, as a fan of Tintin comics (grew up reading it again and again), I loved it!!!"
Binayak,I really loved this movie.
Nathan,"_Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_ is fantastic! This entry is another drastic step up from the previous film and the tone takes a dramatic shift in terms of seriousness.

The quality and cinematography are simply brilliant in this film. There are so many amazing shots and sequences that just had me completely enamored. These films are ahead of their time for sure.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has the best plot of the series so far. There is a constant threat looming in the background throughout the entire film that is known from the opening minutes. Sirius Black's menacing posters and headlines create a real sense of danger, and he truly seems mad. The dementors also deliver a serious threat on screen. Their introduction is terrifying, and their presence is felt in every scene.

One of my favorite things about this film is the conclusion, the time traveling elements are perfect and answer so many questions that I had when running through the finale the first time. My fiancé and I were very confused at how things were happening, and I was having a hard time believing it. But it was brilliant the way it looped around, and the audience was given more background information that made those scenes complete.

The trio of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint elevate their performances once again. Their chemistry is amazing, and I have a feeling this complement will be handed out during every film until the conclusion. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Sirius Black and one of the more compelling ""villains"" of the series so far. Michael Gambon does an excellent job filling in for the late Richard Harris, it was really difficult to even tell that it was a different actor.

My only complaint about this film was the beginning of the movie was slightly rushed. I felt like from when Harry left the Dursley's to when he arrived at Hogwarts the audience was whipped around from location to location, and it was hard to keep track of why. But the plot settles in and finds it's groove after that and delivers a near perfect conclusion.

**Score:** _87%_ |
**Verdict:** _Excellent_"
John Chard,"King George angry at them white fellas. King George say them white fella bad spirit. Must be taken from this land. 

Australia is directed by Baz Luhrmann and Luhrmann co-writes the screenplay with Stuart Beattie, Ronald Harwood, and Richard Flanagan. It stars Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, David Wenham, Bryan Brown and Brandon Walters.

It took a bit of a kicking from the pro critics upon release, where the consensus is that at a cost of $130 million this intended sprawling epic is an ambitious flop. For the record at the box office it practically made double its outlay, so certainly wasn't a financial flop.

It's a mixed bag for sure, a film of two differing halves. First half sends Kidman's English aristocrat to Northern Australia after she inherits the sprawling Faraway Downs Ranch. Here she finds herself in the middle of a dirty take over plot and reluctantly makes a working pact with Jackman's stock-man Drover. Seeds are sewn here for a bit of a screwball relationship, all while a cattle feud brews and the Aborigines at the ranch - particularly young Nulllah (Walters) - are in fear of racial tension. Pic then flip-flops into a love story, a war story (as the Japanese attack Darwin) and the bile strewn historical strand that features the ""stolen generations"" of half-white/half-Aboriginal children. 

With all this going on, as Lurhman nods to classic epics from classic era past, the vistas are stunning and the hard work of cattle ranching is given genuine credence (helps having the rugged Jackman leading the way). Set pieces are exciting, the Japanese aerial attacks realistic for dramatic worth, while the chemistry between the leads, a worthy child performance from Walters and a quality weasel villain turn from Wenham ensure performances don't harm the pic in that department. There's even the likes of Ben Mendelsohn and John Jarratt in secondary support slots. 

It isn't all it can be, and tonally it feels like there might have been some behind the scenes interference (three co-writers probably didn't help). Yet there are some genuine moments of fun and beauty here, mixed with some heart string tugs and reflection of an historical time that should never ne forgotten. Luhrman reached for ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" and didn't quite make it, but it's honourable and has some damn fine craft for entertainment purpose. 7/10"
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"I was not impressed by this movie. Having said that I do not think it deserves the many 1 star ratings that it have received nor do I think that the acting by neither Will Smith nor his son Jaden was as bad as some people claim. My gripe with this movie lies more with the actual implementation of the story.

The basic idea is not really a bad one. It could have been made into a rather good movie. However the result that we see is rather shallow. Worse it is riddled with stupidities and illogicalness.

The movie starts off with the all too common humans are destroying the planet, we are so bad, bla bla. I am so tired of seeing that crap being stuffed into movies (and books) left right and center. When I read want to ponder those questions I read the appropriate science papers. Stop stuffing it in my face when I just want to be entertained.

Then we get to know that some alien presence where dropping monsters on the humans. Monsters that where genetically bred to kill humans. Okay…? If they wanted to exterminate us why make it in such a long-winded way? And what happened afterward? When it apparently failed to exterminate us did they just go “oh well” and left?

The basic story of the film is that the ship carrying Cypher and Katai crash lands on old Earth which are now supposedly inhabitable for humans. Okay but, apart from the fact that a thousand years in the future one would have thought that they could avoid meteor storms easily, what is this mumbo jumbo that Cypher can somehow “feel” the storm coming?

Let us continue with Earth itself. It is supposed to be inhabitable for humans. Could they not have made a little better effort to make it look inhabitable then? It looks like a semi-tropical/tempered paradise to me. Also, the temperatures are supposed to drop to well below zero every night yet the vegetation is abundant and green? While we are on the subject of vegetation, how the bloody hell can they need “breathing pills” when the vegetation, and thus the oxygen production, is that abundant? Things like this just sticks out like a sore thumb and drags down the movie.

Then we have these Ursa’s. They are bread for the purpose of exterminating humans. They are blind and tracks the humans by the fear pheremones. Say again? What kind of idiot alien would do such a thing? Any bioengineer worth their salary would ensure that such a creature had every advantage they could get. That would include sight and hearing as well as smell (and probably a few other senses like infrared as well). Also, this idea of having to be fearless is just dumb. Apart from simple things like staying downwind the only thing the humans would have to do was to outfit their soldiers with airtight combat suits.

I am not saying that a science fiction movie (or any movie) should be all science and believable but this movie is just too filled with glaring stupidities. For me it is not the total turkey that some people seems to think it is. It has some entertainment value but not more than 4 out of 10 stars worth."
r96sk,"<em>'Dinosaur'</em> is pretty impressive in parts. I felt entertained watching it.

The animation, twenty years on, is still admirable. The environments remain beautiful, the living creatures may not look quite as superb but are still nice in my opinion. The voice cast are understated yet suitable, much like everything else from the music to the plot.

D. B. Sweeney plays the lead role, portraying a character called Aladar. His voice isn't as strong as I'd want but he does a good job nevertheless. Alfre Woodard stands out slightly as Plio, I recognised her voice instantly having seen her years back on TV's <em>'Desperate Housewives'</em>.

Heftier voices and a more dramatic score would've taken this further in my estimations, though there's no doubting this is a film that has many elements to enjoy."
Reno,"So the final movie in the trilogy. That's what I'm hoping for. Because when the first movie came I thought it was a nice idea and then its sequel was so bad without any further innovative ideas to add up. I was not expecting the third movie, but it made its way and I give it a try only to get disappointed.

Ben Stiller is a fine actor and a great director, this trilogy was just a passing cloud in his career, other I would have blamed him for accepting the offer. As we know its a multi star movie, in that I am very happy to see Robin Williams one final time. What a great actor, lucky we had him in our time. The funny thing is I am confused for Rebel Wilson as Melissa McCarthy, but soon after realised.

The rest of the cast, Wilson, Coogan, Kingsley and other were what to say, their existence were in individual narrow thin lane in a weak story. Badly needed a fresh plot in the well known concept from the last two movies, and it did not give us. Hope the reboot would be very creative in the each three. May be it should set in the Hollywood studios like Marvel, Disney et cetera. Because, as I am a movie fanatic, love to see some of my favourite characters like Gandalf the gray, Joker et cetera, as well as beasts like Godzilla, King Kong et cetera come alive at night. It would be so awesome. Anyway, this movie was just okay for a certain reason. Don't expect high, because it won't serve you.

Alba11_Rose27,Is very very funny!!! I like the movie...
John Chard,"Night at the Museum: The Closure.

Part 3 - and expected last instalment - of the poplar NATM series pitches Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) on a mission to save the magic stone that brings his exhibit friends to life. So off he goes to London where new characters and new exhibit creatures join the frothy frolics.

In truth it's all very predictable and plays exactly like the money maker it is, but as with the other two films prior to this one, it has bundles of joy for the kiddies, whilst inserting some dark patches and edgy gags for the benefit of the adults. There's fun cameos, one of which is a joyous belter, and all the returning cast members are joined by an ebullient Dan Stevens as Sir Lancelot.

For a series closer it could have disgraced itself, but with some neat injection of ideas and decent story telling, it winds up as above average. The caveat, though, is that at the same time it convinces that the franchise has very much run its course. 6/10"
John Chard,"Ahh, the magic begins.

Harry Potter is an Orphan who on his eleventh birthday discovers he's a wizard and is called to term at Hogwarts School. But Harry is soon to find out that his past, and his destiny, is a truly remarkable, magical, and terrifying thing.

Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone arrived in a blaze of publicity, one of the most hyped and talked about motion pictures of the decade had finally arrived. The box office was guaranteed to bulge based on fandom book base alone, regardless of if the film got bad word of mouth or not, it was destined to be a monster smash hit. To someone like me who to this day has never read any of the Harry Potter books, it was easy for me to view objectively without comparison to the source - I enjoyed it immensely upon theatre release, and I still enjoy it equally as much now.

Director Christopher Columbus, I believe has wisely stayed loyal to the source material, and thus pleased the literature masses. Yet not all newcomers to the party were that taken by the magic on show, that's a little baffling to me because the budget explodes from the screen at every turn. Oliver Twist like sets form the marvellous Diagon Alley, dream like smoke cloaks the splendid Hogwarts Express, the school itself is a monolithic delight nestling in among eerie mountains - and what about the exhilarating introduction of Quidditch? Pulsating and frantic with no amount of devilment to keep us intrigued throughout.

The characters are all perfectly formed in the first two thirds of the film, here Columbus pulls off a masterstroke by interjecting the character arcs with dashes of wonder so that we the audience never gets bored. The final reel plays out solidly as per the mysterious ""who done it"" core of the piece, but it's down to the previous work in the film that we actually care come the finale. Some great casting of the adults really helps to make the film triumph, with Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane (one of the best casting jobs of the decade I would say), Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Zoe Wanamaker all doing excellent work here. The kids are all newcomers that overnight were to become household names, all fresh faced and wet behind the ears, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint & Tom Felton are a delight to watch, and they all help to keep the feeling of charm constantly glowing up on the screen.

Owls here, witches there, what's that strange three headed dog doing over there? The Harry Potter franchise begins with a bang and a whip of the wand, and I and gazillions of others personally love it. 8/10"
Venti_Pro,"Alright first lets start with my problems with this movie.
Some of the effects do not hold up and that can take away from the magic or suspense.
The child actors are not very good at acting in this movie.
 It is way to easy to nitpick this movie and all the nitpicks can be very distracting.
I think the main theme was used way to much in the beginning and that kind of took the magic out of the main theme for me.
I personally did not get sucked into this world which made me kind of bored at times.
People love the harry potter movies but these movies don't really click with me when it comes to characters, the lore, and the magic and I think the full story of harry potter is to drawn out and I just want the movies to get to the point.
For me if the ending of the film is not very satisfying my respect for the movie drops a ton and I don't think the ending of this movie was very satisfying!
The villain in this movie is super basic.
Now on to the good stuff!
I like how most of the scenes build up the characters, show us some magic, and it builds up the mystery!
I like the sets and costumes a lot!
I like most of the music!"
Nathan,"_Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone_ is a masterclass is world building. This movie's world breathes and slowly discovering every inch of it is a joy, from Diagon Alley to Hogwarts Castle.

I would not say the story is overly brilliant, but that is just a catalyst for the world in this first film. Despite its minor drawbacks, it does enough to intrigue the viewer and kept me engaged.

The performances are a little off, which is expected as this film is primarily carried by three twelve-year-olds. But they get better as the film progresses and the adults in the film are able to bring the average up with their amazing performances.

Overall, this movie suffers from being dated with poor effects, CGI, and some rough child acting. Never-the-less, it manages to create an experience like no other and I expect the films to do nothing but improve from the initial entry.

**Score:** _77%_ |
**Verdict:** _Great_"
Per Gunnar Jonsson,"As far as I am concerned this is another movie that demonstrates that the rating  of the so-called “professional” critics used by Rotten Tomatoes are next to useless, at least as far as I am concerned and the official rating system at RT in general is deeply flawed. Yes I know that I have been harping about this before but I think it deserves to be repeated. Sure, this movie is not the greatest I have ever seen but come on! If you go to the movie’s page at RT you see a big rotten 13% flashing at you. That makes the unaware reader think the movie is a real turkey and that to me is just recycled bull food.

At sites like IMDb and TMDb the movies gets around 5.5 out of 10 which, although not great, is much more reasonable. Also the viewer rating says 42% which looks bad but if you look at the details you see that the average rating is 3 out of 5 stars which to me is more an “okay” rating. The RT ratings is seems to be made to make all movies except the blockbusters look bad.

Anyway, with that little rant over with, let us get to the movie itself. Personally I found it a quite entertaining movie that could have been better. There are quite a few funny scenes and the special effects are not bad.

Jeff Bridges is quite funny as the veteran sheriff although his character is still one of the things that could have been done better. He is supposed to be the knowledgeable veteran but in many scenes it seems like the other way around. His stubborn stupidity is sometimes rather annoying.

The plot is fairly simple and straightforward. Nothing fantastic and a bit contrived perhaps but good enough to string the special effects scenes together leading up to the grand finale. The cumin nonsense and the scene where Roy is stuffing his head with spicy food to get a dead to reveal himself is a bit of a downer though.

A lot of people have been claiming that it is a M.I.B. rip-off. I think that is rubbish. Yes, there are similarities but then every movie with a veteran, a rookie and a sci-fi or a fantasy theme could be said to be a rip-off in that case. There are so many movies made that one will always find similarities. Just live with it.

As I write before, on the whole I found the movie rather entertaining and me and the kids sure enjoyed our movie evening."
John Chard,"Ah, but you have heard of me.

The crew of the Black Pearl are cursed by something most unimaginable, the only way to lift the curse is to return a lost Aztec coin to its treasure chest home. In the way of them achieving their goal is the British Governor's daughter, the son of Bootstrap Turner, oh and a former comrade by the name of Captain Jack Sparrow who the crew had left to die on an island some time ago.

It's now common knowledge that Pirates Of The Caribbean is a film based upon a theme park ride of the same name, thoughg that ride is not actually a roller-coaster, it's fair to say that this film most assuredly is. A swashbuckling ripper of an adventure yarn cramming in every pirate film staple it can and pouring on layers of charm at every turn. Into the broth goes romance, comedy and striking adventure, and director Gore Verbinski even manages to give the children watching little slices of horror, not enough to keep them up at night, but enough to bring on an uneasy grin.

It's unashamedly commercial, produced by that purveyor of OTT entertainment values, Jerry Bruckheimer, it was to be expected, but few blockbusting movies of the new age can lay claim to being such an out and out reason for having fun. This is the reason why Pirates had few peers at the time of its release, for it knows its reason for being, it's not taking itself seriously. The audience is not being hoodwinked in any way, they are having fun because so is the film and so is, crucially, the impressive cast. Johnny Depp as Sparrow is having the time of his life, basing the character around the dubious mannerisms of Rolling Stone icon, Keith Richards, it works to its highest potential and Depp is simply wonderful in the role. Keira Knightley (perfectly cast), Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, Jack Davenport, Jonathan Pryce and Mackenzie Crook all do what was asked, which is essentially say your lines right and have a blast with it, it really is that sort of picture.

The subsequent sequels would forget what made this first offering so enjoyable, foregoing the outrageous sense of fun for a dark sheen and character development. That is a shame, but at the very least we still have this wonderful picture to go back to time and time again, to lift you up when one is down or to keep one happy when one is already in that happy place. The Curse Of The Black Pearl is a joy from start to finish. 9/10"

CinemaSerf,"Well, the problem with having a part one is that you just know that nothing much is going to happen as we build up to the next film's denouement. ""Katniss"" (Jennifer Lawrence) finds herself on a ship with ""Finnick"" (Sam Claflin) where she discovers that the erstwhile baddie ""Plutarch"" (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is really on their side as she is whisked to the long-thought destroyed District 13 where she meets ""President Coin"" (Julianne Moore), who leads a semi-militaristic society bent on deposing the Capitol. Unfortunately, not everyone managed to escape from the collapsing dome and poor old ""Peeta"" is being used, shamelessly, by the authorities to try and paint ""Katniss"" as the epitome of revolution and evil and so the scene is set: rescue him and mass their forces for an attack that will eliminate the totalitarian regime once and for all. Aside from one of two combat scenes, very little actually happens here. There is a great deal of dialogue, plenty of moralising and if I'm honest, ""Coin"" doesn't come across as any more trustworthy than the man she hopes to succeed. There simply isn't enough by way of plot to sustain this for two hours and the acting still, largely, refuses to engage me. Liam Hemsworth (""Gale"") features a little more, but the confused does she/doesn't she romance stuff is exasperating as this supposedly emotionally and sexually charged environment delivers nothing by way of passion - indeed the pace of the whole thing borders on the racial. Sure, it looks great but I feel that the writing is very much on the wall for part two - my expectations are pretty low."

When he is joined by Parisian cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Tautou), it quickly becomes apparent that nothing is as it first seems and a mystery begins to unravel that could shake Christianity to its very core.

I haven't read the book! And I love treasure hunt/clue chasing movies! So I came to Ron Howard's hugely successful film (over $600 million in worldwide profit) bereft of literary pressure and with only a modicum of genre expectation. Perhaps this is why I'm apparently only in a small percentage of film lovers who really enjoyed the film? In spite of those gargantuan financial figures.

Ultimately it's very safe film making, with a director and cast guaranteeing professionalism, but it weaves a magical mystery tour full of cryptic clues, secret organisations and cover ups. Yes, there is a good deal of corn thrown in as well, which inevitably stops the adaptation from being hyper intelligent. There's also an understanding on my part as to why many feel it's just too talky, but was the film ever going to be unfurled as an action movie blockbuster for the popcorn munching crowd, like National Treasure et al?

It is a clever conspiracy thriller full of twists and turns with a outlandish revelation at the finale. It's also very appropriately performed by the cast (serio brooding and fret), and when McKellen joins the fray after an hour of film it has a little class as well, while Zimmer's score is a majestic blending of choir, strings and synths. I maintain that the film didn't deserve the critical whacking it got, but again I say I had a blank canvas going in for my first viewing. 

I wasn't sold to it because of controversy or had a saliva tinged mouth having worshipped at the altar of Dan Brown, I expected exactly what I got. A flawed but ever so intriguing adult mystery thriller, and not even Hanks' hair stopped me having a great time with the movie. 7/10"
Peter McGinn,"Writing this review might be considered an act of vanity. Until recently I was among the very few who hadn’t seen The Da Vinci Code, or even read the book. But now I have done so — watch the movie, that is. I still have no plans to read the book. But is there anyone left out there who might benefit from a review?

Mostly I thought the movie was rather silly. Oh, I know that the book was researched about as well as your average documentary, and that the plot is intricate and suitably complex for a thriller. Like a spy thriller, it develops that the two heroes can never be sure who they can trust. In fact, the short answer seems to be “No one!” There are plenty of plot twists, reverses and surprising  revelations, some nifty but others that are utterly predictable. But it lost some of its credibility for me near the beginning when the female lead drove her car at a high rate of speed in reverse in and around traffic, faster than most drivers could manage driving forward. Really?

There is a lot of action in the movie, but it lacks the exuberance and humor of a classic like Raiders of the Lost Ark. I guess religion is a serious business."
r96sk,"Naught terrible about it, but <em>'Rio 2'</em> is a boring - if colourful and well meant - follow-up to the 2011 original.

The whole plot is basically just a typical family drama fest, filled to the brim with the clichés of relative and love quarrels. It's also entirely predictable, which doesn't help. A few of the characters from the first film are shoehorned in too, especially Nigel (Jemaine Clement).

Jesse Eisenberg (Blu) and Anne Hathaway (Jewel) reprise their roles, Eisenberg is the better of the two. Bruno Mars joins the cast, I actually liked his voice for Roberto but unfortunately his character is forgettable.

I'd guess the younger viewers will like this, as well as a number of others. For me, it's just very average."
tmdb44006625,"X2: X-Men United is an improvement over its predecessor in just about every way. Better story, better effects, better action, and more interesting mutants. It's the best of the original X-Men films and a high point for early 2000s comic book moviemaking. Worth watching for the Wolverine vs Lady Deathstrike fight alone."
Kamurai,"Good watch, might watch again, and can recommend.

Again, horrible ""comic book movie"", good stand alone movie.

Wolverine was the most interesting thing about the last movie, and this is a surprising instance of a studio realizing audience feedback and basically just made the first Wolverine origin movie, because that's what this is.

Comic continuity aside, and Wolverine aside, the war of the Brotherhood of Mutants is fairly compelling angle to take, and it is refreshing they did it from the human's side, but if you look at it closer, then we're just looking at another race war.  It sort of takes the fuel out of the fire when you realize how ""real"" your super power problem story is.

While this has a slightly better premise, and good plot skeleton, there is a lot of ""(mostly Wolverine does) something cool here"" stuff, but there are at least 2 large exceptions with multiple mutants working together that end up being a ""lot of cool stuff"", but also add some significance to the story and heavily progress the plot.

I'd honestly recommend anyone watch this over the original."
r96sk,"Strong sequel.

I didn't quite enjoy <em>'X2'</em> as much as <em>'X-Men'</em>, though not by much in truth. This follow-up film is still something I'd class as entertaining. Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) again impresses, though those behind him are - though all good - a little meh in my opinion; especially newcomer Brian Cox (Stryker), who underwhelmed me.

All in all, it's a film that is totally worth watching and is a sequel that is worth its salt.

CinemaSerf,"I think this is better than the first film though I still find Patrick Stewart's ""Picard""-in-a-chair character really irritating. Anyway, this time we have a good baddie in Scotsman Brian Cox (""Stryker""). He is a determined military man who manages to get the US President to give him carte blanche to take on and eliminate the mutants after a failed attempt to assassinate him in the White House. ""Magneto"" (Ian McKellen), meantime, is still locked up in his plastic prison but his shape-shifting blue protegé ""Mystique"" (Rebecca Romijn) concocts a cunning pan to free him; and just in time too! ""Stryker"" has discovered the existence of ""Cerebro"" and determined to control it, attacks the ""Xavier"" school neutralising many of the students and leaving only ""Logan"" (Hugh Jackman),"" Scott"" (James Marsden) and ""Rogue"" (Anna Paquin) to lead what's left of their team to extricate the now captured professor. Needs must, as they say, and an unlikely alliance forms with ""Magneto"", but will it hold and as we build to quite an exciting denouement, we realise that there is still plenty of scheming and plotting going on. Cox is not really a very versatile actor, but here he provides a solid fulcrum for a story that has plenty of action. There is much less emphasis on the moralising, hormonal, frat-style storyline of the 2000 version; the characters are older and better developed and can control, therefore use, their powers to more dramatic effect for those watching. The story is still a bit thinly predictable, but the visual effects team pull out all the stops keeping this 2¼ marathon moving along surprisingly effortlessly. I'm now very much in team ""Magneto"" - bring on X3!"
ohlalipop,"I'm not really a fan of these kinds of movies. I haven't even seen parts 1 and 2. I've seen part 3 (Tokyo Drift) which I think was a waste of time. I've seen part 4 just because everyone's watching it and surprisingly I liked it. I was even surprised to find out that Bryan O'Conner (Paul Walker) was a policeman. Haha!

So here I am, watching the fifth installment. Justine wanted to watch it badly and since I have nothing to do, I decided to accompany her. She was on leave the whole week and she just got back from Palawan. So before watching the movie, the 2 of us had dinner at Jack's Loft. I told her that we should buy tickets first but because we were lazy we forgot about it. When it was an hour before the movie, we were surprised. Sold out. Well, nearly sold out. There were like less than 10 seats. So we still went in line and luckily got seats even if the seats were bad and we were seated separately from each other. 

I liked this movie. Although it was very unrealistic. (Hello? Where's the government of Rio?) I like how The Rock was there. I like him. I don't like Vin Diesl. I don't understand a word coming out of his mouth. Jordana was still pretty but she's not as pretty in this film. She's too thin. But all in all I liked it."
mooney240,"**Fast Five brings the action, beloved old characters, exciting new ones, and a whole lot of fun to the Fast franchise and the heist genre.**

Fast 4 and Fast 5 are the best of the Fast & Furious franchise. Fast 4 redeemed the series after the failure of Tokyo Drift by bringing back Vin Diesel and the cast and family of the first film. Then Fast 5 expands and adds to the crew with fan-favorite characters from across the series, including Han (Kang), Roman (Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Gisele (Gadot), and more. The Toretto family plans a massive heist to buy their freedom but hot on their tale is Dwayne Johnson’s Hobbs, a perfect foil to Diesel’s Toretto. The face-off between these characters is epic! Fast Five’s bonkers action is a little more grounded than later entries, but it’s still outrageous fun. It feels kind of like The Italian Job, directed by Michael Bay. Fast Five launched the Fast Franchise into another decade of insane stunts and stories with great characters and commitment to embracing its cheesy awesomeness."
